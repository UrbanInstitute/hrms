	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Michael Karpman, Genevieve M. Kenney, Sharon K. Long, and Stephen Zuckerman</h3>
    <p>February 19, 2015</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Though the most recent health insurance Marketplace open enrollment period officially ended February 15, 2015, state and federal policymakers are considering a special enrollment period for uninsured individuals who find they are subject to the penalty for not having coverage in 2014 and have not yet enrolled in Marketplace coverage for 2015.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> An extended enrollment period would be expected to lead to more coverage among the remaining uninsured, many of whom could learn that they are subject to a penalty when they file their 2014 taxes and could be motivated to purchase coverage in order to avoid having to pay what would likely be an even higher penalty in 2016 for not having insurance in 2015 (Dorn 2015).<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Washington State has already extended open enrollment past the tax filing deadline to accommodate the uninsured who become aware of the penalty and had not previously enrolled in a Marketplace plan.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> <br />
</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We use data from the December 2014 round of the Urban Institute&rsquo;s Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) to explore awareness of the penalty and the open enrollment deadline, as well as expectations for paying the penalty, among uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 with family incomes above 100 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). We focus on uninsured adults with incomes above 100 percent of FPL because they are most likely to be subject to the penalty, in contrast to poor uninsured adults who would likely qualify for an exemption.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Many nonpoor adults who were uninsured as of December 2014 had heard little or nothing about the penalty, were unaware of the February 15 deadline to obtain coverage through the Marketplaces, and did not know if they would be subject to a penalty for not having coverage in 2014. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><em>More than 4 in 10 uninsured adults who may be subject to the penalty have heard little or nothing about it.</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Among adults who were uninsured as of December 2014 and had family incomes above the federal poverty level, 19.3 percent had heard only a little about the penalty for not having coverage in 2014, and 24.8 percent had heard nothing at all about the penalty. Just over half (53.5 percent) had heard some or a lot about the penalty.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p><a href="../images/Tax-Penalties-Quicktake-Fig1.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/Tax-Penalties-Quicktake-Fig1.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p><em>Most nonpoor uninsured adults do not think they will be subject to the penalty or do not know.</em></p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>Only one-quarter (25.1 percent) of uninsured adults with incomes above 100 percent of FPL expected to pay the penalty for not having coverage in 2014. Four in 10 (40.5 percent) did not know if they would need to pay the penalty, and nearly 3 in 10 (27.9 percent) did not expect to pay the penalty. Though there are several ways to qualify for exemptions to the penalty, many uninsured adults in this income range will likely have to pay the fine. </p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p><em>Two-thirds of nonpoor uninsured adults do not know about the Marketplaces or the open enrollment deadline or think the deadline is in March. </em></p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>About 3 in 10 (29.7 percent) uninsured adults with incomes above 100 percent of FPL reported not having heard about the Marketplaces, 28.7 percent had heard about the Marketplaces but did not know when open enrollment ended, and 6.9 percent had heard about the Marketplaces and thought the enrollment deadline was in March. Only 32.8 percent had heard about the Marketplaces and thought the deadline was in February or earlier. Other survey data show similarly low awareness of the open enrollment deadline among uninsured nonelderly adults (DiJulio, Firth, and Brodie 2014).</p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>Most of those who were unaware of the penalty also appeared to be unfamiliar with the Marketplaces and the open enrollment deadline. Among uninsured adults with incomes above 100 percent of FPL who had heard only a little or nothing at all about the penalty, more than 80 percent had not heard about the Marketplaces, had heard about the Marketplaces but thought the open enrollment deadline was in March, or had heard about the Marketplaces but did not know when the open enrollment period would end (data not shown). </p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>Though Marketplace enrollment has increased since December 2014,<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> these results suggest that a special enrollment period could help a significant segment of the remaining uninsured who learn about the penalties when they file their 2014 tax returns.</p>
