	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Michael Karpman, Stephen Zuckerman, and Fredric Blavin</h3>
    <p>February 5, 2015</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s second open enrollment period for obtaining health insurance through the Marketplaces ends February 15, 2015. Between November 15, 2014, when the second open enrollment period began, and January 16, 2015, more than 7.1 million individuals enrolled or reenrolled in health insurance plans through the federal Marketplace.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> During approximately the same period, nearly 2.4 million enrolled in state-based Marketplaces.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Despite these numbers, there may be many more adults who remain uninsured and still plan to enroll before the end of the open enrollment period. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In this QuickTake, we use data from the December 2014 Health Reform Monitoring Survey to assess how much adults ages 18 to 64 who were uninsured at the time of the survey understood about the Marketplaces and how likely they were to enroll in a health plan through a Marketplace. We also determine whether uninsured adults who had heard about the Marketplaces and planned to enroll were aware of the open enrollment deadline.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We find that as of December, approximately 70 percent of uninsured adults reported that they had heard &ldquo;a lot,&rdquo; &ldquo;some,&rdquo; or &ldquo;only a little&rdquo; about the Marketplaces (figure 1).<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> In addition, 35 percent of all uninsured adults reported that they planned to enroll in a health plan through a Marketplace (figure 1). These findings were similar for the subset of uninsured adults who are in the Marketplace target population (those with income above 138 percent of the federal poverty level in states expanding Medicaid and those with income above 100 percent of the federal poverty level in states not expanding Medicaid; data not shown). </p>

	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>Though these estimates suggest the potential for further gains in national insurance coverage and increases in Marketplace enrollment through the end of the open enrollment period, we also found confusion about the open enrollment deadline. Over 4 in 10 uninsured adults who had heard about the Marketplaces and planned to enroll either did not know when the open enrollment period ended or thought it ended in March (figure 2). Nearly half (45 percent) thought the deadline was earlier than February, so they still had the opportunity to enroll after the time of the survey. Only 12 percent of uninsured adults who had heard about the Marketplaces and who planned to enroll actually identified the correct month when open enrollment ends. Although some uninsured adults may qualify for special enrollment periods after February 15 if they experience certain life changes, most uninsured adults in the Marketplace target population who do not enroll by the deadline will not be eligible for coverage through the Marketplaces until enrollment reopens in fall 2015.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Although many uninsured adults were aware of the Marketplaces and planned to enroll in a health plan as of December, the findings presented here show that there are still many who need to learn more about the Marketplaces. Even among those interested in enrolling, we find sufficient confusion about when open enrollment ends that many may miss the opportunity to purchase coverage for 2015.</p>
