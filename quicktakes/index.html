	<h2>QuickTakes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This series highlights timely data from the Health Reform Monitoring Survey, a quarterly survey of the nonelderly that is using Internet-based survey methods to monitor the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before data from federal government surveys are available.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>QuickTakes provide information on health insurance coverage, access to and use of health care, health care affordability, and self-reported health status, as well as quick data on important implementation issues under the ACA.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
