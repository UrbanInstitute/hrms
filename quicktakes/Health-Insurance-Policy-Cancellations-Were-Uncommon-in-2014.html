	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Lisa Clemans-Cope and Nathaniel Anderson</h3>
    <p>March 12, 2015</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Under the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s (ACA) provisions that took effect in  2014, most nongroup health insurance plans and small-employer group plans were  required to offer a minimum set of benefits and services, including coverage  for prescription drugs, maternity care, and mental health services. These plans  were also required to comply with new consumer protection regulations, such as  prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions and premiums based on health  status or sex. Most of these ACA requirements do not apply to large-employer  group plans, self-insured health plans, or grandfathered health plans (i.e.,  plans that were created before the ACA was enacted).<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Our  estimates from the December 2013 Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) show  that almost one in five (18.6 percent) of those with nongroup health insurance  (i.e., directly purchased coverage in the individual market) report that their  plan would no longer be offered to them in 2014 because it did not comply with  the ACA&rsquo;s new coverage requirements.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> We estimate that these findings translated to approximately 2.6 million people  reporting policy cancellations caused by noncompliance in 2013. Cancellations  in the small-group market were not widely reported in 2013, possibly because (1)  some employers renewed their coverage early to delay  compliance with the ACA&rsquo;s reforms for up to one year and (2) many small-group  plans already met the ACA&rsquo;s requirements.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>,<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> Media  reports predicted an increase in small-group plan  cancellations in fall 2014.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In response to consumer complaints about canceled plans, in mid-November  2013 the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a new  transitional policy permitting states to let  insurers continue noncompliant plans in 2014.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> In March 2014, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced an  additional extension through 2017, after which all nongrandfathered,  noncompliant plans must be terminated.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> In all, 40 states have allowed  some continuation of noncompliant plans in the nongroup or small-group markets.<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Recent evidence suggests a small number of canceled nongroup policies  in 2014.<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> And though many states permitted continuation of noncompliant plans, cancellations  were predicted in the small-group market in 2014 as small  employers and insurers discover business or consumer reasons to shift  enrollment to compliant plans.<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> Yet evidence of significant numbers of small-group cancellations in  2014 has not yet surfaced. Thus, the extent of policy cancellations in 2014 caused  by noncompliance with the ACA is largely unknown, making the extent of the  disruption hard to assess. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>To address this data gap, this QuickTake uses data from the December 2014  HRMS to assess how many&nbsp;adults ages 18 to 64 reported that they received a  letter that their insurance would be canceled, and we assess the reasons for  these cancellations. Our analysis includes those with nongroup insurance or  employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) at the time of the survey. Although the  cancellation issue primarily affects small-group insurance, the sample sizes  for this analysis do not allow us to distinguish between small- and large-group  employer insurance. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We find that  as of December 2014, the vast majority of those with nongroup coverage (91.8  percent; 95 percent CI [89.7, 94.0]) reported they either did not receive a  letter about their health plan and any changes that will happen in 2015 or  received a letter but it was not a cancellation notice (data not shown). Of  those with nongroup coverage, 5.6 percent (95 percent CI [4.2, 7.1]) reported  receiving a letter saying that their plan was canceled for 2015 either because it did  not meet new coverage requirements or for an unknown reason (figure 1). This  estimate includes 2.2 percent (95 percent CI [1.0, 3.5]) of adults with  nongroup coverage who reported that their plan was canceled for 2015 because it did not  meet new coverage requirements and another 3.4 percent (95 percent CI [2.1,  4.7]) who received a letter saying that their plan was canceled but they did  not know why.<a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="../images/QuickTake-Cancellation-Fig1.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/QuickTake-Cancellation-Fig1.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Nearly all  (98.1 percent; 95 percent CI [97.6, 98.5]) of those with ESI reported that they  did not receive a letter about changes to their plan in 2015 or received a  letter but it was not a cancellation notice (data not shown). Of those with ESI  coverage only, 0.6 percent (95 percent CI [0.4, 0.8]) reported receiving a  letter saying that their plan was canceled for 2015 because it did not meet new coverage  requirements or for an unknown reason. This estimate includes 0.3 percent (95  percent CI [0.1, 0.5]) of adults with ESI who reported that they received a  letter saying that their plan was canceled for 2015 because it didn't meet new coverage  requirements, and another 0.3 percent (95 percent CI [0.1, 0.5]) who received a  letter saying that their plan was canceled, but the respondent did not know  why.<a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>To put these  findings in context, we estimate the number receiving cancellations for each  health insurance type by applying the share of adults reporting that their plans were canceled because of noncompliance with  the ACA to nationally representative counts of nongroup and ESI coverage. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Nationally  representative estimates suggest that approximately 17.6 million people were  enrolled in the nongroup market in the third quarter of 2014.<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a>> Using this as a rough estimate of nongroup enrollment in  December 2014, our findings imply that roughly 0.4 million people in the  nongroup market reported that their plan was canceled for 2015 due to noncompliance with  the ACA (not including those whose plan was canceled for unknown reasons). </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Nationally  representative estimates from the 2013 American Community Survey reflect  coverage at the time of the interview in 2013, and recent findings based on  2014 HRMS data provide evidence that ESI coverage held steady through 2014  (Blavin et al. 2014). The American Community Survey data estimate that  approximately 168.1 million people were enrolled in ESI in 2013.<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> Using this as an estimate of December 2014 ESI enrollment,  our findings imply that roughly 0.5 million people with ESI reported that their  plan was canceled for 2015 because of noncompliance with the ACA&rsquo;s mandates. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>These  estimates suggest that policy cancellations caused by noncompliance with the  ACA were uncommon in 2014 in both the nongroup and ESI markets, and the number  and rate of cancellations in the nongroup market in 2014 was far smaller than  in 2013. The nongroup market has historically been characterized by high  volatility: an analysis of pre-ACA nongroup coverage patterns from 2008&ndash;11  shows that only 42 percent of nongroup enrollees retained their coverage after 12  months (Sommers 2014). It may still be the case that insurers chose to cancel  policies for business reasons, such as low enrollment, so some cancellations  are to be expected for reasons other than ACA compliance. The nongroup  cancellations caused by unknown reasons may be explained by such business  decisions. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In addition  to the number of adults receiving cancellations appearing quite small, confusion  leading to coverage gaps following cancellation letters in 2014 was likely lessened by several factors. In  2014, unlike in 2013, insurers canceling policies were required to inform  consumers about coverage options in the Marketplace, the possibility of  receiving premium and cost-sharing subsidies for a Marketplace plan,<a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the existence of special enrollment periods available if policies were canceled  outside of the Marketplace open enrollment period. Presumably, such information  would help consumers transition to new, compliant coverage. In addition, with  the state and federal Marketplaces up and running more smoothly in 2014 than in  2013, consumers whose plans had been canceled were able to shop more easily among  plans that include the ACA&rsquo;s consumer protections, required minimum benefits,  and premium and cost-sharing subsidies when eligible. The number of enrollees  still in noncompliant plans is unknown, though the number could be substantial because  estimates suggest that before 2014, more than half of enrollees in the nongroup  market had plans that would not meet the ACA&rsquo;s minimum coverage standards  (Gabel et al. 2012). However, we expect that though cancellations of  noncompliant plans may continue through 2017, disruption should be limited because  consumers are now likely to have access to information about coverage options  and coverage through their state or federal Marketplace. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><em>Methods: To obtain these estimates, we drew  on the following series of questions. We first asked respondents, &ldquo;</em><em>Did you receive a  letter about your current health insurance plan and any changes that will  happen in 2015?&rdquo; Those who answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; were then asked, &ldquo;Which of the  following describes the purpose of the letter(s) you received?&rdquo; Responses  included To inform you that your policy is canceled or will no longer be  offered&rdquo;; &ldquo;To inform you that you will automatically be enrolled in your  current health insurance plan or a similar plan&rdquo; (this response option was only  available for those who reported enrolling through the Marketplace); &ldquo;To inform  you about options and deadlines for enrolling in a new health insurance plan  for 2015&rdquo;; &ldquo;To inform you about changes in your health insurance plan, such as  the premium you pay, the benefits that will be covered, or the out-of-pocket  costs (deductible, co-payments, or coinsurance) you will pay for health care in  2015&rdquo;; &ldquo;To inform you about changes to your premium tax credit and other  savings you had in 2014&rdquo; (this response option was only available for those who  reported enrolling through the Marketplace); and &ldquo;Other (please specify).&rdquo; Those who indicated that they received a letter  about plan cancellation were asked, &ldquo;Is your policy being canceled  because it does not meet coverage requirements under the health care law?&rdquo; This  series of questions is different from those used in o</em><em>ur estimates of policy cancellations from  December 2013 HRMS, so the estimates are not directly comparable.</em></p>
