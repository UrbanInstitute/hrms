	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Genevieve M. Kenney, Adele Shartzer, Sharon K. Long, Stephen Zuckerman, Douglas Wissoker, Michael Karpman, and Nathaniel Anderson</h3>
    <p>July 15, 2014</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The Urban Institute's Health Reform Monitoring Survey  (HRMS) has been tracking insurance coverage since the first quarter of 2013. This  QuickTake reports on how the distribution of the nation&rsquo;s uninsured changed through  early June 2014 between Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states, following the  Affordable Care Act's (ACA) first open enrollment period.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> Under the ACA, new financial assistance for health insurance coverage is  available through Medicaid and the new Marketplaces. As of June 2014, 25 states  and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid to adults with incomes up to  138 percent of the federal poverty level.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> In states that expanded Medicaid, an estimated 71 percent of the uninsured likely qualify for some type of financial assistance for health insurance, compared with  44 percent of the uninsured in the states that did not expand Medicaid  (Buettgens et al. 2014); consequently, greater reductions in uninsurance are  anticipated in Medicaid expansion states.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <a href="../images/States-Not-Expanding-Medicaid-under-the-ACA.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/States-Not-Expanding-Medicaid-under-the-ACA.png" width="600" border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consistent with expectations, HRMS data  reported elsewhere show that states that implemented the ACA's Medicaid  expansion saw larger declines in their uninsurance rates for adults between  2013 and June 2014 than did nonexpansion states (Long et al. 2014). Because of  the differential declines in uninsured rates, we find that the uninsured are  increasingly located in states that did not choose to expand Medicaid. Just before  the beginning of open enrollment in September 2013, 49.7 percent of the  nation&rsquo;s uninsured were living in a state that did not expand Medicaid under  the ACA; by June 2014, that figure had risen to 60.6 percent. To put that  figure in context, 46.6 percent of the total US population resides in the  states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> As Medicaid outreach continues under the ACA in the expansion states, the  uninsured are likely to become even more concentrated in states that have opted  to not expand Medicaid to their low-income residents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Methods: Each round  of the HRMS is weighted to be nationally representative. We present estimates  from September 2013, just before the beginning of the first open enrollment  period, and compare to estimates from June 2014. The estimates presented here  are not regression adjusted to stabilize the sample composition over the period  of analysis, because the goal is to measure how the composition of the uninsured  has changed. Some portion of the difference in the estimate of the share of  uninsured residing in Medicaid expansion states between September 2013 and June  2014 may be attributable to quarterly differences in the HRMS survey sample. However,  the overall share of nonelderly adults living in nonexpansion states is similar  across the two quarters (45.1 and 45.2 percent, respectively). We will provide  a more detailed analysis of remaining uninsured adults in a policy brief to be  released at the end of July, with other analyses to follow regularly. </em></p>

For example, many of the nonexpansion states did not set up their own Marketplaces and therefore did not get the same access to outreach and enrollment assistance funding. </p>
