	<p>The Urban Institute&rsquo;s Health Reform  Monitoring Survey (HRMS) has been tracking health insurance coverage among  nonelderly adults since the first quarter of 2013.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> The  HRMS, which was designed to provide early feedback on implementation of the  Affordable Care Act (ACA), found that uninsured rates had declined by 4.0  percentage points among nonelderly adults between September 2013 (just before the  first open enrollment period began) and June 2014, with larger declines found  in states that have expanded Medicaid (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Wissoker, et  al. 2014). Beginning  in June 2013, the HRMS added a supplement to track changes in coverage and other  outcomes for children under the  ACA. This brief examines findings from the HRMS children&rsquo;s supplement.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In contrast to adults, uninsured rates for  children had been declining in the decade before the ACA&rsquo;s passage (Kenney,  McMorrow, et al. 2012). By 2012, just 7 percent of children lacked health  insurance coverage.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> This is largely because of the expansion of public coverage, which is  substantially more generous for children than for adults. More than half of all  states offer coverage through Medicaid or the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance  Program (CHIP) to children in families with incomes that are 250 percent of the  federal poverty level (FPL) or above (Heberlein et al. 2013). In addition, children&rsquo;s  participation in Medicaid/CHIP is higher than adults&rsquo; participation in  Medicaid, and children&rsquo;s participation has been rising following the passage of  the CHIP Reauthorization Act in 2009, reaching 88.1 percent in 2012.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>  Under  current law, with the exception of immigrant subgroups, just over half the  states have a Medicaid and CHIP eligibility threshold for children of 250  percent of FPL or higher; just five states (AK, AZ, ID, ND, OK) have thresholds  below 200 percent of FPL, and 19 have thresholds above 300 percent of FPL. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The  major ACA coverage provisions, including the state option to expand Medicaid to  nearly all adults with family incomes at or below 138 percent of FPL<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> and the provision of federal  subsidies to purchase coverage in the new health insurance Marketplaces, were  primarily designed to reduce uninsurance among adults. To date, eligibility for  Marketplace subsidies has had a small effect on children (only 6 percent of  enrollees in Marketplace plans are under 18), but several other components of  the ACA also have the potential to affect children&rsquo;s coverage (Assistant  Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 2014). These include the individual  requirement to obtain coverage (i.e., the individual mandate) and the &ldquo;welcome  mat&rdquo; or &ldquo;woodwork&rdquo; effects of other ACA provisions on children&rsquo;s participation  in Medicaid and CHIP. In particular, the expansion of coverage to parents&mdash;especially  in those states that have opted to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA&mdash;is  expected to improve the participation rate of their children.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> New  outreach and enrollment investments under the ACA may also increase  participation, and the required movement of approximately 28 percent of CHIP  children with incomes between 100 and 138 percent of FPL into Medicaid<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> (i.e.,  &ldquo;stairstep kids&rdquo;) will eliminate premiums facing some families, which could  further increase participation in public coverage among children (Prater and  Alker 2013). </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Simultaneously, there have been considerable  challenges in the past year affecting enrollment and potentially retention in  Medicaid and CHIP; these could limit any possible coverage improvements for  children observed for children by June 2014. These challenges are related to the  change to modified adjusted gross income as the basis for Medicaid eligibility and  disconnects between existing Medicaid and CHIP programs and new federal or  state Marketplaces.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> Overall, given the potential benefits of the ACA, experts project increases in  coverage among children under the ACA over the long term, particularly if the  current structure of public coverage is maintained for children (Kenney et al.  2011).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Though several tracking surveys,<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> including the HRMS, have shown declines in the  uninsured rate among nonelderly adults since late 2013, no published report has  yet examined how coverage has changed for children over this period (Collins,  Rasmussen, and Doty 2014; Carman and Eibner 2014). We use the HRMS child  supplements from June 2013 through June 2014 (HRMS-Kids) to examine changes in  health insurance coverage for children. We also use data from the March and  June 2014 HRMS-Kids to examine the income distribution of uninsured children  and assess how their access to care and preventive care receipt compares to that  of insured children. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>What We Did</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our analysis compares the uninsured rate for children (from  birth to age 17) through quarter 2 of 2014 (survey fielded in early June 2014)  to rates estimated in previous quarters with data collected beginning in June 2013.  The core HRMS targets nonelderly  adults; if a respondent to the core survey reports that there are any children  in the household, a sample child is selected and the respondent&mdash;the child&rsquo;s  parent in the majority of cases&mdash;is asked to provide information about the  health and healthcare of the child.<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> Though we include information for all three quarters of 2013 for which  we collected information on children, we focus on changes between quarter 3 of  the 2013 HRMS-Kids, fielded in September 2013 (just before the first  Marketplace open enrollment period was initiated), and quarter 2 of the 2014  HRMS-Kids, fielded in June 2014 (the most recent estimates available).<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Though each round of the HRMS-Kids is weighted  to be nationally representative, it is important in examining changes over time  that we base our estimates on comparable samples over time. This is a  particular challenge in comparing estimates from survey samples over time  because the composition of the sample that is surveyed can change across rounds  in ways that are not fully captured in the weights and that may distort the  estimates of change. To control for the potential influence of changes in the  HRMS-Kids sample characteristics, we estimate weighted regression models that  control for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, internet access, and  geography.<a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> Controlling for differences in  respondents&rsquo; characteristics through time allows us to remove any variation in  insurance coverage caused by changes in the types of people responding to the  survey (rather than by changes in the health insurance landscape). In presenting  the regression-adjusted estimates, we use the predicted rate of uninsurance in  each quarter for the same nationally representative population. For this  analysis, we base the nationally representative sample on survey respondents  from the most recent 12-month period from the HRMS-Kids (i.e., quarters 3 and 4  of 2013 and quarters 1 and 2 of 2014). The basic patterns shown for the  regression-adjusted uninsured rates for children are similar to those based  solely on simple weighted (unadjusted) estimates. In presenting our findings on  coverage changes, we focus on statistically significant changes in insurance  coverage over time (defined as differences that are significantly different  from zero at the 5 percent level or lower) relative to September 2013, just  before the open enrollment period for the Marketplaces began. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The HRMS child supplement has a sample of  between 2,363 and 2,777 children each quarter, substantially smaller than the  7,500 adults interviewed each quarter. Consequently, the estimated uninsured  rate for children is relatively imprecise, especially relative to the low  uninsured rate for children at baseline: the minimum difference between  quarters in the uninsured rate for children that we can detect with a high  degree of confidence is 3.2 percentage points, which would represent a change  of roughly 44.9 percent. (For nonelderly adults in the HRMS, the minimum detectable  difference is 2.1 percentage points, which is smaller in absolute terms and, at  10.0 percent, constitutes a much smaller share of the higher adult uninsured  rate.) Because of the imprecision of our estimates of change for children, we  present the 95 percent confidence interval around each quarterly estimate of  the uninsured rate. The imprecision of the quarterly uninsured estimates for  children combined with the early stages of ACA implementation and the small  projected changes in children&rsquo;s coverage make it unlikely that we will detect  statistically significant changes as of June 2014.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We use the HRMS-Kids sample from the first two  survey rounds in 2014 to provide a current snapshot of the income distribution for  uninsured children, pooling together the two quarters of data to achieve more  precision (the combined sample of uninsured children from the two rounds is 312).  We also assess access and affordability of care for insured and uninsured children  using the pooled March/June 2014 data. Specifically, we look at difficulty  paying any of a child&rsquo;s medical bills in the past year; confidence in meeting a  child&rsquo;s needs; receipt of a routine checkup in the past year; whether the child  had an unmet need (because of affordability) for prescription drugs, medical  care, a general doctor, a specialist, medical tests, treatment, or follow-up  care, dental care, mental health care or counseling, or eyeglasses or vision  care; and whether the child had one or more usual sources of care. For these  comparisons, our regression-adjusted differences control for many child and  family characteristics.<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> The adjusted differences were designed to make uninsured children more  comparable to the insured children in terms of their observed health,  demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. However, these differences cannot  be interpreted as causal, because we are not addressing unobserved differences  between insured and uninsured children that could also affect these outcomes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Found</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>No statistically significant change was&nbsp;found at  the national level in the estimated uninsured rate for children age 17 and  under between September 2013 and June 2014; the uninsured rate for children  remained at very low levels but did not decline further. </em>In June 2014, the uninsured rate for children was estimated to be 7.3  percent (95% CI [6.3, 8.4]) for the nation (figure 1). No statistically significant  change was found between the estimated uninsured rate for children in any of  the final three quarters of 2013 and June 2014 (data not shown).&nbsp; When we  tested the uninsured rate for children in the pooled March/June 2014 HRMS-Kids  samples against the rate found from pooling different combinations of the  quarterly 2013 HRMS-Kid samples, we found no statistically significant changes  in the uninsured rate for children for these comparisons either.&nbsp; As  indicated above, the lack of a statistically significant change in the  uninsured rate for children over this time frame is not unexpected given both  the size of the quarterly HRMS child sample and the small changes that are  anticipated under the ACA in coverage for children compared to adults, which  reflects the low baseline uninsured rates for children. In contrast, for  parents, where the sample size and minimum detectable difference are nearly  identical to those for children on the HRMS, we found a statistically  significant decrease of 2.4 percentage points between September 2013 and June  2014 in the uninsured rate for parents (Kenney, Anderson, et al. 2014).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>The majority of uninsured children  appear to be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but are not yet enrolled. </em>Over  half (55.8 percent (95% CI [42.8, 68.9])) of uninsured children sampled in  March/June of 2014 are in families that have incomes at or below 138 percent of  FPL, and another 25.2 percent (95% CI [16.5, 33.8]) have incomes between 138  and 250 percent of FPL; an estimated 19 percent (95% CI [12.3, 25.6]) have  incomes at or above 250 percent of FPL (figure 2). Under current law, with the  exception of a subset of immigrant children, uninsured children with family  incomes at or below 138 percent of FPL are eligible for public coverage through  Medicaid; likewise, many uninsured children with family incomes between 138 and  250 percent of FPL are eligible for public coverage through Medicaid or CHIP. For  some uninsured children with family incomes at or above 250 percent of FPL,  Medicaid or CHIP coverage may be available if they live in one of the 29 states  (plus DC) that cover children in this income band; alternatively, they may be  eligible for subsidized coverage through the new Marketplaces, provided their  families do not have access to affordable employer sponsored coverage for the  employee as defined under the ACA.<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="../images/brief26Fig2.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/brief26Fig2.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Uninsured children are more likely  than insured children to experience access and affordability problems and less  likely to receive preventive care.</em>Relative to insured children, uninsured children  are much more likely to have had a need for health care in the previous year  that was unmet because of affordability concerns and to have parents who say  they have difficulty paying the child&rsquo;s medical bills. Uninsured children are  also much less likely to have a usual source for health care and to have  received a routine checkup in the previous year, and more likely to have  parents who say they lacked confidence that they can meet their child&rsquo;s health  care needs (figure 3). For example, parents of uninsured children were 7.9  percentage points (95% CI [3.1, 12.6]) more likely than parents with insured  children to report any difficulty paying their child&rsquo;s medical bills in the  past year (18.4 percent, 95% CI [14.1, 22.7] compared with 10.6 percent, 95% CI  [9.6, 11.5]). Additionally, uninsured children were 26.6 percentage points (95%  CI [21.6, 31.6]) less likely to have had a routine checkup in the past year (58.1  percent (95% CI [53.1, 63.2]) compared with 84.7 percent (95% CI [83.4, 86.0])).<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="../images/brief26Fig3.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/brief26Fig3.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Estimates derived from HRMS-Kids suggest that uninsured  rates for children had not changed by June 2014, following the first open  enrollment period that began on October 1, 2013. Though ultimately the ACA  could further reduce uninsured rates among children from their current low  levels, at this early point following the initial open enrollment period, we are  not detecting any statistically significant change in the uninsured rate for  children since September 2013. A definitive assessment of the magnitude of the  changes in coverage occurring for children nationally and by state and  population subgroups will require data from federal surveys, with their  stronger designs, larger sample sizes and much higher response rates. In  addition, deriving causal estimates of the effects of the ACA on health  insurance coverage for children will ultimately require accounting for changes  in health insurance coverage that would have occurred independent of the ACA  and for ACA-related policies implemented prior to 2014 that could have affected  coverage for children, such as the maintenance of eligibility provision which  required that states maintain their 2010 Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels  for children and the additional federal funding allocated for CHIP through fiscal  year 2015. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though these data suggest that the ACA did not  reduce the number of uninsured children between September 2013 and June 2014,  there are reasons to expect that children&rsquo;s coverage will grow in future years,  assuming that current levels of Medicaid and CHIP eligibility are maintained.  The significant technological challenges associated with establishing federal  and state Marketplace portals and the delays in transferring eligibility data  between agencies are expected to improve as states continue to work through significant  backlogs in processing applications. These Marketplace portals are an important  avenue through which many families are applying for Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace  coverage. <br />
  Ultimately, new systems will tap electronic  sources of data to streamline the eligibility process and reduce administrative  barriers to coverage. However, the process of developing and deploying new  technology and procedures is inherently difficult and further complicated by  increased application volume and significant changes to eligibility and annual  redetermination processes. Therefore, there is considerable uncertainty over  how quickly state Medicaid and CHIP agencies will implement new systems and  business processes that efficiently coordinate coverage with the Marketplaces and  adjust to the new income definition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many other factors may also affect the uninsured  rate for children going forward. Further take-up of the Medicaid expansion for  adults under the ACA could have a positive effect on children&rsquo;s coverage given  that four of the six states with the largest number of uninsured children (FL,  GA, NC, and TX) and six of the eight states with uninsured rates for children  of more than 10 percent have yet to extend Medicaid to low-income parents  (Mancini and Alker 2013). Between September 2013 and  June 2014, the uninsured rate had declined by 2.4 percentage points for parents  for the nation as a whole and by 5.0 percentage points for parents living in  states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA (Kenney, Anderson, et al. 2014). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extent of federal funding for CHIP beyond fiscal  year 2015, which will be determined in the coming year, will also likely affect  uninsurance among children. Some children losing CHIP coverage would qualify  for subsidized coverage through the Marketplace, but others would be blocked  from receiving financial assistance for Marketplace coverage if they have  access to affordable employer-based coverage (Kenney et al. 2011). Currently,  affordable employer-based coverage&mdash;for both individuals and families&mdash;is based  on the cost of individual coverage, and does not consider the often  significantly higher costs of a family plan. Recent estimates suggest that as  many as half of children with Medicaid or CHIP coverage and incomes above 138  percent of FPL may not qualify for Marketplace subsidies based on their access  to employer-based coverage (McMorrow et al 2014).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strong support for insuring America&rsquo;s  children exhibited at both the federal and state level before the ACA&rsquo;s  enactment contributed to a steady decline in the uninsured rate for children.  As states achieve high-functioning, data-driven eligibility and enrollment  systems under the ACA, enrollment and retention of eligible children in  Medicaid and CHIP should continue to improve. Though the prospects are good for  achieving further improvements in coverage for children in the coming years, preserving  and building on the existing coverage gains for children will require that  affordable coverage options remain available for children. </p>

    <p><strong>About the Series</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This brief is part of a  series drawing on the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS), a quarterly  survey of the nonelderly population that is exploring the value of cutting-edge  Internet-based survey methods to monitor the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before data  from federal government surveys are available. The  Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) is supported by multiple foundations and  the Urban Institute. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Ford Foundation  provide funding for the core survey and the topical modules. The Child  Supplement was conducted in partnership with the Center for Children and  Families at Georgetown University and funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, the  David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and an anonymous donor.

        <p><a name="fn1" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>1</sup>The HRMS is a quarterly survey drawn  from KnowledgePanel, a probability-based Internet panel maintained by GfK  Custom Research and based on a representative sample of US households. The core  HRMS targets nonelderly adults because the ACA coverage expansions primarily  affect this population. Because children may also experience significant  effects of the ACA, HRMS-Kids was added to the core survey in summer 2013. If a  respondent to the core survey reports that there are any children in the  household, a sample child is selected and the respondent&mdash;a child&rsquo;s parent, in  the vast majority of cases&mdash;is asked to provide information about that child&rsquo;s  health and health care experiences. This brief presents estimates based on data  collected in June, September, and December 2013 as well as March and June 2014.  For more information on the HRMS-Kids, see McMorrow et al. (2014). We  benchmarked the HRMS (both adult and child samples) to existing federal surveys  (the American Community Survey and the National Health Interview Survey) for  overall characteristics, the coverage distribution, and access and  affordability of care. HRMS estimates of the uninsurance rates for all children  and different age and racial or ethnic subgroups were very similar to those  from the American Community Survey. Rates of health care use on the HRMS-Kids  are comparable to those on the National Health Interview Survey, with just over  80 percent of children on each survey reporting a routine checkup in the past 12  months. However, compared to the National Health Interview Survey, the HRMS  finds higher reported access problems for both children and adults.<br />

<a name="fn4" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>4</sup>Twenty-four states  and the District of Columbia had expanded by April 1, 2014. The list of states  that have expanded Medicaid is increasing over time as more states decide to  implement the ACA expansion. States that expanded Medicaid by June 1, 2014, are AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA, KY, MD, MA,  MI, MN, NV, NJ, NM, NY, ND, OH, OR, RI, VT, WA, and WV.  Several of those states (CA, CT, DC, and MN) expanded Medicaid to adults under  the ACA before 2013. In August 2014, New Hampshire began covering adults under  the Medicaid expansion, and Pennsylvania obtained approval for a waiver to  expand coverage to adults. <br />

<a name="fn6" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>6</sup>The 28 percent who were required to  move does not include the estimated 870,000 that moved from separate CHIP  programs to Medicaid in California and New Hampshire because of state choices.<br />
<a name="fn7" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>7</sup>According to Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services (2014), information released for a subset of states by the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows a small average monthly  increase of .58 percent in child enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP between  January and June of 2014. No baseline data is available from 2013, and data was  only reported by 38 states.<br />

<a name="fn9" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>9</sup>The respondent was a child&rsquo;s parent or  guardian in 11,977 out of 12,822 observations. Approximately 800 children were  screened out of the sample because the adult respondent said that they could  not report on the child&rsquo;s health or health care experiences. The child selected  is the one with the nearest birthday to the interview date.<br />
<a name="fn10" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>10</sup>Although Marketplace coverage for people enrolling between October and December 2013 did not start until January 2014, some  who signed up in the fall may have reported having coverage during the December 2013 HRMS survey.  Further, some of those seeking coverage through the Marketplace between October  and December 2013 were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP coverage. <br />
<a name="fn11" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>11</sup>Specifically, we control for the variables used in the poststratification weighting of the KnowledgePanel  (the Internet-based survey panel that underlies the HRMS) and the poststratification weighting of the HRMS, which include the child&rsquo;s age, sex, and race and ethnicity, as  well as the respondent&rsquo;s sex, age, race and ethnicity, language, education, marital status, number of children present in the household, household income, family income as a  percentage of FPL, homeownership status, internet access, urban or rural status, and census region.  In  addition to assessing changes in insurance coverage for all children as reported in this brief, we  also assessed changes over time for the following subgroups of children: age (0  to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17), sex (female and male), income (&le;138% of FPL, 138&ndash;399%  of FPL, and &ge;400% of FPL), race and ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black or  African-American non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other or multiple race  non-Hispanic), and Medicaid expansion type (expanding and nonexpanding), but  did not detect any statistically significant changes over time for these  subgroups. <br />
<a name="fn12" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>12</sup>The  control variables used to compare measures between insured and uninsured  children include the child&rsquo;s age, sex, race and ethnicity, general and mental  health status, and functional limitations. For the respondent, the control  variables are marital status, education, family income, homeownership status,  census region, and metropolitan statistical area status.<br />
<a name="fn13" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>13</sup>Kenney, Lynch, et al. (2012) find that  approximately 70 percent of uninsured children in 2010 were eligible for  Medicaid or CHIP.</p>
<a name="fn14" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>14</sup>These differentials hold up, both in terms of  direction and magnitude, when controlling for observed differences between  insured and uninsured children such as their age, sex, race and ethnicity,  general and mental health status, and functional limitations, as well as their  parent&rsquo;s marital status, educational attainment, family income, homeownership  status, census region, and metropolitan statistical area status.
