	<p>The Urban Institute&rsquo;s Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS)  has been tracking health insurance coverage among nonelderly adults (ages  18&ndash;64) since the first quarter of 2013. Like other tracking surveys (Collins,  Rasmussen, and Doty 2014; Carman and Eibner 2014),<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> the HRMS shows that  the uninsured rate has fallen among nonelderly adults since late 2013. This  decrease follows the implementation of  major components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the  expansion of Medicaid to nearly all adults with family incomes at or below 138  percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) in 25 states and the District of  Columbia<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the provision  of federal subsidies to purchase coverage in new health insurance Marketplaces. To date, no published report has  examined how coverage has been changing for parents living with their dependent  children. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Understanding how the ACA is affecting parents  is important for many reasons. In 2010, an estimated 11.5 million parents were  uninsured (Heberlein et al. 2012). Relative to childless adults, Medicaid eligibility  was more generous for parents before the ACA, yet half the states had Medicaid  eligibility thresholds for parents that were less than two-thirds of FPL (often  much less). Further, an estimated 2 million uninsured parents were eligible for  Medicaid but not enrolled (Heberlein et al. 2013). </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Reducing uninsurance among parents not only has  the potential to benefit parents, but also may have positive spillover effects  on children as their parents&rsquo; health and financial well-being improves. For  example, depression in parents has been shown to pose risks to children&rsquo;s  cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral development, especially early in  childhood, and it is linked to health and mental health problems for children  as they grow (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000). Coverage expansions targeting parents  have also been found to increase children&rsquo;s enrollment in Medicaid and the Children&rsquo;s  Health Insurance Program (Dubay and Kenney 2003).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We use the June 2014 HRMS to examine changes in  health insurance coverage for parents since September 2013. For analysis of the  characteristics of the parents who remained uninsured in the first half of  2014, we pooled the March and June 2014 samples to increase the sample size. The  HRMS was designed to provide early feedback on ACA implementation to complement  the more robust assessments that will be possible when the federal surveys  release their estimates of changes in health insurance coverage later in 2014  and in 2015 (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Goin, et al. 2014). This brief builds on  estimates from early July 2014 that showed an estimated gain in coverage of 8.0  million among all nonelderly adults (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Wissoker,  Shartzer, Karpman, and Anderson 2014).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Did</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our analysis compares the uninsured rate for nonelderly  parents through quarter 2 of 2014 (survey fielded in June 2014) to rates  estimated from data collected during 2013. Parents included in our analytic sample are defined as either parents  or guardians living with a dependent child age 17 and under who were willing  and able to answer questions about their child&rsquo;s health and health care.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> We focus on estimated changes in the uninsured rate because estimates of  the level of uninsurance often vary across surveys because of differences in  the surveys that would be unrelated to the ACA (State Health Access Data  Assistance Center 2013). We include information for all three quarters of 2013  for which we have a comparable parent status indicator, but focus on changes  between quarter 3 of the 2013 HRMS, fielded in September 2013 (just before the  first Marketplace open enrollment period was initiated on October 1, 2013), and  quarter 2 of the 2014 HRMS, fielded in June 2014.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Though each round of the HRMS is weighted to be  nationally representative, it is important in examining changes over time that  we base our estimates on comparable samples over time. For example, if the  share of those with insurance grows simply because more respondents were older  or from higher income groups in one round of the survey, it would be incorrect  to associate such a change with the ACA Marketplaces and Medicaid expansions.  This is a particular challenge in comparing estimates from survey samples over  time because the composition of the sample that is surveyed can change across  rounds in ways that are not fully captured in the weights and that may distort  the estimates of change.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To control for the potential influence of  changes in the HRMS sample characteristics, we estimate weighted regression  models that control for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, Internet  access, and geography.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> Controlling for differences in respondents&rsquo; characteristics through time allows  us to remove any variation in insurance coverage caused by changes in the types  of people responding to the survey (rather than by changes in the health  insurance landscape). In presenting the regression-adjusted estimates, we use  the predicted rate of uninsurance in each quarter for the same nationally  representative sample of parents. For this analysis, we base the nationally  representative sample on the most recent 12-month period from the HRMS (i.e.,  quarters 3 and 4 of 2013 and quarters 1 and 2 of 2014).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We consider changes in insurance coverage for  (1) all nonelderly parents; (2) parents with incomes below 400 percent of FPL,  targeted by Medicaid expansion and subsidized coverage through the new  Marketplaces; and (3) parents in states that had and had not adopted the ACA&rsquo;s  optional Medicaid expansion by June 1, 2014. We focus on statistically  significant changes in insurance coverage over time (defined as differences  that are significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level or lower) and  highlight changes relative to September 2013, just before the open enrollment  period for the Marketplaces began. We provide a 95 percent confidence interval  (CI) for key estimates. The basic patterns shown for the regression-adjusted  measures are similar to those based solely on simple weighted (unadjusted)  estimates. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We also assess changes between September 2013  and March/June 2014 (pooling the March and June 2014 HRMS samples together) in  the distribution of uninsured parents between the group of states that expanded  Medicaid and the group that did not expand Medicaid.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> Finally, we use the pooled March/June 2014 data to assess characteristics of  the remaining uninsured: race and ethnicity, language spoken, highest level of  education attained, region, urban or rural status (whether the respondent lives  in a metropolitan statistical area), self-reported health status, and number of  days in the past 30 days reported to be in poor mental health. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Found</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Nationally, between  September 2013 and June 2014, the estimated uninsured rate for parents fell 2.4  percentage points from 16.7 percent to 14.3 percent, a drop of 14.4 percent.</em> In June 2014, the uninsured rate for nonelderly parents was estimated to be  14.3 percent (95% CI [12.5, 16.2]) for the nation (figure 1, table 1).<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> The  uninsured rate declined for parents by 2.4 percentage points (95% CI [0.2,  4.6]) between September 2013 and June of 2014, a drop of 14.4 percent. This  compares with the decline of 22.3 percent found in the uninsured rate for all  nonelderly adults over this time frame (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Wissoker,  Shartzer, Karpman, Anderson, and Hempstead 2014).</p>

<p><em>Large  gains in coverage were found for parents living in states that expanded  Medicaid under the ACA; in those states, the uninsured rate dropped by 5.0  percentage points, a decrease of 33.3 percent from September 2013.</em> The  uninsured rate for parents in states that adopted the ACA's Medicaid expansion  dropped 5.0 percentage points (95% CI [2.8, 7.1]) since September 2013; there  was no significant change in the uninsured rate in the nonexpansion states (0.04  percentage point increase; 95% CI [-2.7, 2.8]). This represents a decline in  the uninsured rate of 33.3 percent in the expansion states. In June 2014, the  uninsured rate for parents in the 25 nonexpansion states was 19.0 percent (95%  CI [17.5, 20.5]), well above the 10.0 percent rate (95% CI [8.5, 11.4]) in the  expansion states.<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninsured parents are increasingly located in  states that have not expanded Medicaid (figure 2.) The share of parents living  in states that have not expanded Medicaid increased from 50.9 percent (95% CI  [21.4, 80.4]) in September 2013 to 61.3 percent (95% CI [27.9, 94.8]) in  March/June 2014. Small sample sizes do not allow us to pinpoint the changes  between September 2013 and June 2014, our most recent estimate available, but  given that our estimates indicate a significant increase in the share of  uninsured parents living in nonexpansion states between March and June 2014  (data not shown), it suggests that the shift that has occurred is even larger  than shown in figure 2. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant gains in  coverage have occurred among parents since the beginning of the first  Marketplace open enrollment period in October 2013, especially in the states  that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA and among the populations  targeted by the Medicaid expansion and the new Marketplace subsidies. Altogether,  the uninsurance rate declined by 14.4 percent for parents nationally between  September 2013 and June 2014 and by 33.3 percent for parents in states that  expanded Medicaid. As the ACA moves forward, it will be important to assess (1)  whether these coverage gains translate into improvements in access to care,  health status, and financial well-being for parents and (2) the extent of  positive spillover effects on parents&rsquo; children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though a full accounting of the effects of the  ACA on changes in insurance coverage for parents is not yet possible, these  findings provide evidence that the Medicaid expansion and the provision of  subsidies in the new health insurance Marketplaces are likely contributing to  significant increases in health insurance coverage among nonelderly parents. We  find larger coverage gains in the states that expanded Medicaid for adults, but  cannot definitively attribute those differences to the Medicaid expansion  because expansion states differed from nonexpansion states in other ways that  could affect changes in coverage for parents over this period (Blumberg et al.  2014; Hill, Wilkinson, and Courtot. 2014). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though monitoring surveys like the HRMS provide  estimates of the changes for parents and other subgroups under the ACA, a  definitive assessment of the magnitude of the changes in coverage occurring for  parents nationally and by state and population subgroups (e.g., parents of  young children and parents with chronic health care problems) will have to wait  for data from the federal surveys, with their stronger designs, larger sample  sizes, much higher response rates, and longer time-trends. Moreover, these  estimates of change between September 2013 and June 2014 do not reflect the  effects of some important ACA provisions for parents (such as early state  Medicaid expansions) that were implemented before 2013. Deriving causal estimates  of the effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage will also require  accounting for any changes in health insurance coverage that would have  occurred independent of the ACA. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While increases in coverage for parents as of  June 2014 are noteworthy (particularly in the states that expanded Medicaid,  where the uninsured rate had dropped 33.3 percent since September 2013), many low-income  parents remain uninsured. The benefits of health insurance are well-established  and include reduced financial burdens and improved access to care and related  outcomes for those who gain coverage (Institute of Medicine 2009, Howell and  Kenney 2012, McWilliams 2009, Finkelstein et al. 2012). Of note, given the possible  adverse effects on children, are the poor mental health days for one-third or  more of the previous month reported by over one in six uninsured parents. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, it will be important to identify and  implement policies in the coming months that are successful at expanding  enrollment in available coverage options for parents. The findings from the HRMS  indicate that many parents who remained uninsured as of March/June 2014 have low  levels of educational attainment and may also face language barriers to  enrolling in coverage. Such parents will likely require assistance enrolling in  coverage and selecting a health insurance plan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the nonexpansion states, where the uninsured  rate for parents in the June 2014 HRMS sample was 19.0 percent, many low-income  uninsured parents lack access to affordable coverage.<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> In these states,  additional outreach and enrollment efforts targeted at poor and near poor  adults could increase coverage among parents who qualify for Medicaid under  pre-ACA rules and the subset with incomes between 100 and 138 percent of FPL who  could qualify for subsidized coverage through the new Marketplaces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Medicaid expansion states, where the uninsured  rate for low-income parents with incomes below 138 percent of FPL was 22.3  percent (95% CI [19.6, 24.9]) in June 2014,  the opportunity remains for substantial coverage gains under the Medicaid  program. Automatic enrollment strategies that use the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program or a child&rsquo;s or other family member&rsquo;s enrollment in Medicaid  could be very successful at increasing Medicaid coverage and further reducing  uninsurance among low-income parents in these states (Guyer, Schwartz, and  Artiga 2013; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2014). Many uninsured parents  have children who are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, so using these  programs to identify these children and their parents is likely to be a  particularly cost-effective outreach strategy (Heberlein et al. 2012). </p>

    <p><strong>About the Series</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This brief is part of a series drawing on the Health  Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS), a quarterly survey of the nonelderly  population that is exploring the value of cutting-edge Internet-based survey  methods to monitor the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before data from federal  government surveys are available. The  Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) is supported by multiple foundations and  the Urban Institute. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Ford Foundation  provide funding for the core survey and the topical modules. This brief draws  in part on the Child Supplement, which was conducted in partnership with the  Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University and funded by  Atlantic Philanthropies, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and an  anonymous donor.

        <p><a name="fn2" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>2</sup>States that expanded Medicaid by June 1, 2014, are AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA,  KY, MD, MA, MI, MN,  NV, NJ, NM, NY, ND, OH, OR, RI, VT, WA, and WV. Several of those states (CA, CT, DC  and MN) expanded Medicaid to adults under the ACA before 2013. In August 2014, New  Hampshire began covering adults under the ACA Medicaid expansion and  Pennsylvania had its waiver approved. </p>
        <p><a name="fn3" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>3</sup>The nonelderly parent sample begins in  the second quarter of 2013 and varies between 2,209 and 2,596 in each quarter.  Our sample excludes parents over the age of 64 living with a dependent child  and parents not living in the same household as their child. We do not include  sample adults who are a relative of the sample child unless they indicate that  they are a legal guardian.</p>
        <p><a name="fn4" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>4</sup>Although Marketplace coverage for people enrolling between October and December 2013 did not start until January 2014, some  who signed up in the fall may have reported having coverage during the December 2013 HRMS survey.  Further, some of those seeking coverage through the Marketplace between October  and December 2013 were enrolled in Medicaid. </p>
        <p><a name="fn5" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>5</sup>Specifically, we  control for the variables used in the poststratification weighting of the KnowledgePanel (the Internet-based survey panel that  underlies the HRMS) and the poststratification weighting of the HRMS, which include sex, age, race  and ethnicity, language, education, marital status, household income, family income as a  percent of the federal  poverty level, homeownership status, Internet access, urban or rural status, and census region. </p>
        <p><a name="fn6" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>6</sup>The March and June 2014 quarterly  samples had 315 and 235 uninsured parents, respectively (550 overall). The  September quarterly sample had 310 uninsured parents.</p>
        <p><a name="fn7" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>7</sup>Because of rounding, the percentage-point  differences derived from figure 1 differ slightly from the percentage-point  changes reported in table 1.</p>
        <p><a name="fn8" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>8</sup>Other analyses have found large gains  in states that expanded Medicaid for adults in general, including Long, Kenney,  Zuckerman, Wissoker, Shartzer, Karpman, and Anderson (2014); Sommers et al.  (2014); Jenna Levy, &ldquo;US Uninsured Rate Holds Steady at 13.4%&rdquo;; and Jenna Levy,  &ldquo;In US, Uninsured Rate Lowest since 2008.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><a name="fn9" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>9</sup>In states that did not choose to expand Medicaid, adults with incomes between 100 and 138  percent of FPL who do  not  have access to an affordable offer of employer coverage may be eligible for Marketplace-based subsidies.</p></td>
