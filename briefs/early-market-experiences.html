	<p>As of February 25, 2014, approximately 4  million people have enrolled in a health plan through the health insurance  Marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and approximately  1.85 million people have enrolled since January 1st alone&mdash;more than  an 80 percent increase over enrollment during the Marketplaces&rsquo; first three  months (US Department of Health and Human Services 2014).<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> While the low October&ndash;December 2013 enrollment likely reflects a lack of  awareness of the ACA (Long and Goin 2014) combined with early technical problems  with the federal eligibility and enrollment system (i.e., HealthCare.gov) and the  state-based Marketplaces, the most recent estimates provide some optimism on the  viability of the Marketplaces.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This brief complements Marketplace enrollment  data by providing information about who looked or was planning to look for  health coverage in the Marketplaces during the first two to three months of the  rollout, as well as why and how they looked for information. For example, were populations  targeted by the ACA more likely to look for information in the Marketplaces  than those whose incomes were too high to be eligible for Medicaid or Marketplace  subsidies? Were individuals who looked for information merely window-shopping,  or were they actively seeking to either buy health insurance or determine their  eligibility for Medicaid or Marketplace subsidies? Were the individuals who  looked for information relying on a website or some other information source, such  as call centers, navigators, or insurance agents and brokers?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Did</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This brief draws on data collected in December 2013 from  the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS), the third month following the  rollout of the Marketplaces. The survey asked a sample of nonelderly adults  (age 18&ndash;64) how much, if anything, they had heard about the Marketplaces. The  more than four out of five who had heard about the Marketplaces were asked if  they had looked for health plan information in the Marketplaces. Respondents  who had done so were then asked (1) why,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> (2) which sources of information they used or tried to use, and (3) how easy or  difficult it was to obtain Marketplace information using those sources. Respondents  who reported that they planned to look for information in the Marketplaces were  asked a similar set of questions (except for ease of use).<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We analyze nonelderly adult responses overall  and by age, insurance type,<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> and income.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> We also compare the level of ease or difficulty using the website among adults  in states operating their own Marketplaces with the ease or difficulty of use  among those in states relying on the federal Marketplace.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Found</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Over one-quarter of nonelderly adults had either looked  for information or planned to look for information on health insurance plans in  the Marketplaces as of December 2013.</em> More than one-third of those reporting an  interest in looking for information in the Marketplace had already done so. Slightly  more than one in ten (11.8 percent) had looked in the Marketplace, 17.0 percent  planned on looking, 54.0 percent had not looked and did not plan on looking,  and 17.1 percent had not heard about the Marketplaces (figure 1). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Adults targeted by and expected to benefit from  the ACA reforms&mdash;particularly lower-income individuals, adults with nongroup  coverage, and the uninsured&mdash;were more likely to have looked for or planned on  looking for information in the Marketplaces than their respective reference  groups (figure 1).</em> Almost one-fifth of adults without health insurance (18.8  percent) and 28.1 percent of those with nongroup coverage actually looked in  the Marketplaces between October and December 2013, compared with only 8.8 and 9.0  percent of adults with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) and public coverage,  respectively. An additional 33.2 percent of uninsured adults, 20.4 percent with  nongroup, and 17.3 percent with public coverage planned on looking in the  Marketplace, compared with 11.7 percent of adults with ESI. &nbsp;Overall, roughly half of respondents without  health insurance (52.0 percent) and almost half with nongroup coverage (48.5  percent) had looked or planned to look for information in the Marketplace.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Similarly, 38.2 percent of adults in  lower-income families had looked (13.2 percent) or planned on looking (25.0  percent) &nbsp;for information on health plans  in the Marketplace, compared with 30.8 percent of those in middle-income and 19.3  percent of those in higher-income families. Notably, younger adults (age 18&ndash;34) (19.6 percent) were more likely to plan on looking in the Marketplaces than those age 50&ndash;64 (13.8 percent)&mdash;an encouraging sign that age-related adverse selection in the Marketplaces may well decrease over time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While these ACA target subgroups were more  likely to have looked for or have planned to look for information in the  Marketplaces than their respective reference groups, they were also more likely  not to have heard at all about the Marketplaces. For example, 23.4 percent of  uninsured respondents, 27.0 percent of adults in low-income families, and 22.6  percent of those age 18&ndash;34 had not heard about the Marketplaces&mdash;significantly  higher than the full population average (17.1 percent) and the averages for the  respective reference groups.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
 

    <p><a href="../images/brief15fig1_full.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/brief15fig1_full.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Around 6 out of 10 adults who had already  looked for information in the Marketplaces were actively seeking to purchase  health insurance or determine whether they were eligible for subsidized  coverage; the remaining adults who had looked in the Marketplaces were window-shopping  (i.e., exploring the website, comparing health plan options, or looking in the  Marketplaces for other reasons [table 1]).</em> Around two-thirds of the window-shoppers  wanted either to compare their current health plan to Marketplace plans or to know  more about options in case of a life event (retirement, loss of current  insurance, or start of new business); the rest were just curious to know how  their Marketplace works or were looking for other reasons (data not shown).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Of those who said they were planning on looking  for information in the Marketplaces, almost half (48.0 percent) said they would  be actively seeking either to purchase insurance or to determine if they were  eligible for subsidized coverage. Most of the remainder were likely window-shoppers  (45.3 percent of the total), with only a few (6.7 percent of the total) saying  they had tried to look earlier but found the website was not working (data not  shown).<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>The vast majority of uninsured (86.2 percent)  and lower-income respondents (76.0 percent) who looked for information in the  Marketplaces were seeking to purchase health insurance or determine if they were  eligible for subsidized coverage or Medicaid (table 1).</em> In contrast, only 39.7  percent with ESI and 33.5 percent with incomes at or above 400 percent of FPL  were actively seeking to purchase coverage or determine if they were eligible  for Medicaid or Marketplace subsidies. Adults age 18&ndash;34 were nine percentage  points more likely to be looking for information for these reasons than their counterparts  age 50&ndash;64 (64.2 percent versus 55.2 percent).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Across  all subgroups, those who planned on looking for information in the Marketplaces  were less likely to want to purchase coverage or see if they were eligible for  subsidies or Medicaid compared with those who had already looked in the  Marketplaces. However, consistent with those who had already looked for information,  uninsured and low-income adults who planned on looking in the Marketplaces were  also more likely to want to purchase coverage or see if they were eligible for Marketplace  subsidies or Medicaid than the other coverage subgroups. </p>

<p><em>The vast majority of people who looked for  information in the Marketplaces either used or tried to use a website (figure 2).</em> Among respondents who looked, 85.1 percent had used or tried to use a website;  16.2 percent had used or tried to use a call center; 7.4 percent had used or  tried to use assistance from navigators, application assisters, certified  application counselors, or community health workers; 12.1 percent had used or  tried to use assistance from an insurance agent or broker, and 10.6 percent had  used or tried to use other sources (e.g., assistance from family and friends,  radio, TV, or newspapers). We also find that one-quarter of those that had used  or tried to use a website had also used or tried to use at least one additional  source to obtain information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lower-income adults and adults ages 50&ndash;64 were  less likely to obtain information through a website than their higher income  and younger counterparts. Despite these differences, however, at least 78  percent of each of these subgroups used the website to obtain information in  the Marketplaces (data not shown). </p>

    <p><em>Most adults found the website very or somewhat  easy to use, with the level of ease higher among those in states that operate  their own Marketplaces.</em> Despite well-documented complaints and technical  glitches with Marketplace websites during the survey period, slightly over half  (51.2 percent) of those who used a website to obtain information on health insurance  plans found it very or somewhat easy to use (figure 3). Interestingly, adults  in states that operated their own Marketplaces were more likely to find the  website very or somewhat easy to use (60.5 percent) than those in states that did  not operate their Marketplaces and relied on the federal Healthcare.gov (46.1  percent).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Who?</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although a large majority of people had not heard about  the health insurance Marketplaces or did not plan on using them to look for  coverage, those in the ACA&rsquo;s target population&mdash;adults who were uninsured, had  pre-reform nongroup coverage, or had low incomes&mdash;were disproportionately more  likely to have looked or planned to look for information in the Marketplaces. Given  that more adults were planning to use the Marketplaces as of December 2013 than  had already used them, it is not surprising that enrollment increased at a faster rate in January and February 2014 than it had in the three previous months. While this trend  could continue, future Marketplace enrollment could be limited by the fact that  those who are planning to look in the Marketplace are less committed to purchasing  insurance or determining if they are eligible for subsidized coverage than  those who have already looked. Younger adults were more likely to plan on  looking in the Marketplaces than older adults, implying that the average health  status of enrollees in Marketplace plans could improve over the upcoming months.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is also clear that those most likely to benefit from  ACA coverage reforms are not simply window-shopping in the Marketplaces but are  actively seeking to enroll in Medicaid or private health plans. Almost 90  percent of uninsured adults who had used the Marketplaces did so to purchase  coverage or determine their eligibility for Medicaid or Marketplace subsidies. Of  the uninsured who were planning to look in the Marketplaces, over 70 percent were  also seeking coverage. Large majorities of low-income Marketplace users were  also seeking coverage.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How?</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The clear reason the website problems in the early rollout  period were so important is that the vast majority (85 percent) of adults who  looked for information on health insurance plans in the Marketplaces used a  website. But despite the widely acknowledged website flaws, only about half of  the respondents who used a website found it very or somewhat hard to use. Two more  findings may be important for ACA enrollment efforts going forward: (1) websites in states with a state-based Marketplace were found to be easier to use than websites in states that relied on HealthCare.gov and (2) call centers or navigators had  been used by more than one in five adults who looked for information in the  Marketplace, which could be important for potentially underserved groups. </p>

    <p><strong>About the Series</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This brief is part of a series drawing on the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS), a quarterly survey of the nonelderly population that is exploring the value of cutting-edge Internet-based survey methods to monitor the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before data from federal government surveys are available. The briefs provide information on health insurance coverage, access to and use of health care, health care affordability, and self-reported health status, as well as timely data on important implementation issues under the ACA. Funding for the core HRMS is provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Urban Institute. </p>

    <p><a name="fn2" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>2</sup> See&nbsp;Courtot et al. (2014) for  examples of technical problems faced by HealthCare.gov and some state-based  Marketplaces. The following 15 states operated their own Marketplaces at the  time of this analysis: CA, CO, CT, DC, HI, KY, MD, MA, MN, NV, NY, OR, RI, VT,  and WA. ID and NM also have state-based Marketplaces, but were relying on the  federal Marketplace website at the time of the survey.</p>
    <p><a name="fn3" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>3</sup> This question has eight response  categories, including a fill-in text box option. We created the following  hierarchy of responses because individuals can check more than one reason: (1)  I wanted to purchase health insurance or find out if I am eligible for  subsidies to lower the cost of insurance or eligible for Medicaid, and (2) I  wanted to explore and compare health plan options or looked for other reasons  (which include wanting to compare current health plan to Marketplace plans,  know more about health insurance options for retirement, know more about health  insurance options in case current insurance is lost, know more about health  insurance options in case respondent starts own business, and curious about how  the marketplaces work). </p>
    <p><a name="fn4" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>4</sup> Respondents who planned on looking for  information were given an additional response category (&ldquo;Tried to look earlier  but website was not working&rdquo;) in the reasons question.</p>
    <p><a name="fn5" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>5</sup> We exclude individuals who reported  private health insurance but could not specify the type of coverage from the  coverage subgroup analysis. </p>
    <p><a name="fn6" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>6</sup> We create three categories of family  income: Lower-income&mdash;those with incomes at or below 138 percent of FPL, which  is the income cutoff for Medicaid eligibility in states opting for the ACA&rsquo;s  Medicaid expansion; middle-income&mdash;those with incomes between 138 and 399  percent of FPL, which is the income cutoff for eligibility for Marketplace  subsidies; and higher-income&mdash;those with incomes at or above 400 percent of FPL.</p>
    <p><a name="fn7" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>7</sup> We are unable to analyze the level of  ease or difficulty using sources of information beside the website because of sample  size restrictions.</p>
    <p><a name="fn8" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>8</sup> The  latter group may include some who are interested in purchasing coverage or  determining eligibility for subsidized coverage, as well as &ldquo;window shoppers.&rdquo;</p>
