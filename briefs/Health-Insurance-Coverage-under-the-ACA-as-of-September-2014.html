	<p>The Urban Institute&rsquo;s Health Reform Monitoring  Survey (HRMS) has been tracking insurance coverage since the first quarter of  2013. Data from the HRMS have provided an early look at changes in the nation&rsquo;s  uninsurance rate following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s  (ACA) key coverage expansion provisions, including the launch of new health  insurance Marketplaces and the state option to expand Medicaid to nearly all  adults with family income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> The  HRMS provides early feedback on  ACA implementation to  complement the more robust assessments that will be  possible when the federal surveys, which are on a slower schedule, begin  to release data (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Goin, et al. 2014).<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Between September 2013, just before the first  Marketplace open enrollment period, and early March 2014, just before the end  of the open enrollment period, an estimated 5.4 million nonelderly adults (ages  18 to 64) gained coverage as the uninsurance rate fell by 2.7 percentage points  (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Wissoker, Goin, et al. 2014). By June 2014, following  a surge in Marketplace enrollment in March and April (Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation 2014) and accelerated growth in Medicaid enrollment  through the spring and summer,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> the estimated decline in the uninsurance rate was 4.0 percentage  points&mdash;equivalent to approximately 8.0 million nonelderly adults&mdash;since  September 2013 (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Wissoker, Shartzer, et al. 2014). Data  from other rapid-cycle surveys tracking changes in coverage show similar patterns  (Carman and Eibner 2014; Collins, Rasmussen, and Doty 2014; Sommers et al.  2014), and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3.8  million nonelderly adults gained coverage between 2013 and January-March 2014  (Cohen and Martinez 2014).<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This brief examines continued changes in the  uninsurance rate for nonelderly adults through September 2014, when the most  recent round of the HRMS was completed. Though the Marketplace open enrollment  period ended in April 2014, those who have since experienced a qualifying life  event, such as marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child, or loss of  coverage, have been eligible to apply for coverage through the Marketplace  during a special enrollment period.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> Also, coverage may change because enrollment in Medicaid is available to  eligible adults any time during the year, and the nation&rsquo;s ongoing economic  recovery may cause gains in private coverage. Moreover, states&rsquo; continued  processing of their Medicaid application backlogs may have led to increased  Medicaid enrollment (including coverage retroactive to the application date).<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> Simultaneously, other factors may dampen coverage gains, such as a decline in  coverage because some Marketplace plan enrollees failed to pay their premiums.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Did</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our analysis compares the estimated uninsurance rate for nonelderly adults from September 2013 through September 2014. We focus on estimated changes in  the  uninsurance rate because estimates of the level of uninsurance often vary across survey programs because of differences in  the surveys unrelated to the ACA (State Health Access Data Assistance Center 2013). Although the HRMS includes information for all four quarters of  2013, we focus on changes between quarter 3 2013 (the survey for which was fielded in  September 2013, just before the first Marketplace open enrollment period) and  quarter 3 2014 (the survey for which was fielded in September 2014).<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although  each round  of the HRMS is weighted to be nationally representative, it is important in examining changes over time that we base our estimates on comparable samples over time. For example, if the share of those with insurance grows simply  because more respondents were older or  from higher income groups than in an earlier round of the survey, it would be incorrect to associate such a  change with the ACA Marketplaces and Medicaid expansions. This is particularly challenging for comparing estimates from survey samples over time because the composition  of the sample surveyed can change from round  to round in ways that are  not fully captured in  the weights and that  may  distort the estimates of change. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To control for the potential influence of changes in the characteristics of the HRMS sample, we  estimate weighted regression models that control for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, internet access, and geography.<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> We consider changes in insurance coverage for (1) all  nonelderly adults;<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> (2) adults targeted by the  Medicaid expansion and the Marketplaces;  (3) adults in states that had and  had  not adopted the ACA&rsquo;s optional  Medicaid expansion  by September 1, 2014; and (4) adults in important demographic and socioeconomic  subgroups such as age, gender, race and ethnicity, and family income. Controlling  for  differences in the respondents&rsquo; characteristics through time allows us to remove variation in  insurance coverage caused by  changes in  the types of people responding  to the survey rather than by changes in  the health insurance landscape. In  presenting the regression-adjusted estimates, we use the predicted rate of uninsurance in  each  quarter for the same nationally representative population. For this analysis, we  base the nationally representative sample on survey respondents from the most recent 12-month  period of the HRMS  (i.e., quarter 4 of 2013 and quarters 1&ndash;3 of 2014).  Although we control for sample characteristics over time, we are not attempting  to disentangle the effects of the ACA from other factors that also changed between  September 2013 and September 2014, such as gains in insurance coverage caused  by the economy continuing to recover from the recession. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In discussing our findings, we focus on statistically significant changes in  insurance coverage over  time (defined as differences that are significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level or lower)  and highlight changes relative to September 2013.  We provide a 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for key estimates. The basic patterns shown for  the regression-adjusted measures are  similar to those based solely on  simple weighted (unadjusted) estimates.  To extrapolate our estimates of changes in uninsurance rates to the number of adults who  have gained coverage over the same period, we use projections for the size of the 2014 population  from the US Census Bureau.<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What We Found</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>The number of uninsured nonelderly adults fell by an estimated 10.6 million between September 2013 and September 2014: a drop of 30.1 percent in  the uninsurance rate.</em> In September 2014, the uninsurance rate for nonelderly adults was estimated to be  12.4 percent (95% CI [11.6, 13.2]) for the nation, a drop  of 5.3 percentage points (95% CI [4.3, 6.4]) since September 2013  (figure 1).<a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> </a> Applying the estimated 5.3 percentage-point decrease in  the uninsured rate to the  estimated national population of nonelderly adults implies  that the number of  uninsured adults declined by 10.6 million between September 2013 and  September 2014 (95% CI [8.5 million, 12.6 million]).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Adults in  states that implemented the ACA's Medicaid expansion sustained the large  coverage gains from the previous quarter, and insurance coverage also rose  sharply for adults in nonexpansion states. </em>The uninsurance rate for adults in  expansion states dropped 5.8 percentage points (95% CI [4.5, 7.2]) since September  2013; the rate dropped 4.8 percentage points (95% CI [3.2, 6.3]) in the nonexpansion  states. This is a decline in the uninsurance rate of 36.3 percent in expansion  states and 23.9 percent in nonexpansion states. Most of the estimated decline  in the uninsurance rate in the nonexpansion states occurred between June and  September 2014 (figure 1). Consequently, the gap in the uninsurance rate between  expansion and nonexpansion states, which had widened between September 2013 and  June 2014, narrowed somewhat between June 2014 and September 2014. Nonetheless,  in September 2014, the uninsurance rate in expansion states was 4.9 percentage  points lower than in nonexpansion states; that difference was 3.8 percentage points  in September 2013. In September 2014, 54.7 percent of uninsured adults resided  in nonexpansion states.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="../images/brief28Fig1.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/brief28Fig1.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Low- and middle-income adults targeted by the ACA&rsquo;s key coverage provisions reported large gains in insurance  coverage.</em> Insurance coverage increased by  12.0 percentage points  (95% CI [9.2, 14.7]) between September 2013 and September 2014 for low-income adults (those with family income at or below 138 percent of FPL, the target population for the ACA's Medicaid  expansion) and by 5.2 percentage points (95% CI [3.4, 6.9]) for middle-income adults (those  with family income from 139 to 399 percent of FPL, the target  population for the new  health insurance subsidies available through the Marketplaces)  (figure 2).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="../images/brief28Fig2.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/brief28Fig2.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Low-income adults targeted by the Medicaid expansion had  large gains in insurance coverage in expansion  states (figure 3). Insurance  coverage increased by 14.7 percentage points (95% CI [9.7, 19.7]), or 40.2 percent, between September 2013 and September 2014 for low-income  adults in expansion states. Dissimilar to earlier HRMS findings, insurance  coverage increased 9.2 percentage points (95% CI [6.9, 11.4])  for low-income adults in nonexpansion states, with the majority of the increase  occurring between June and September 2014. This increase in coverage was likely  caused by a gain in Medicaid coverage: there was no evidence of an increase in  employer-sponsored coverage over the period (data not shown), and most of the  low-income adults would not be eligible for subsidized Marketplace coverage. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Middle-income adults who could potentially qualify for Marketplace subsidies experienced similar gains in  coverage in  expansion and nonexpansion states from September 2013 to September 2014: an increase of 5.2 percentage points  (95% CI [3.3, 7.2]) and 5.0 percentage points (95% CI [2.1, 7.9]), respectively. </p>

    <div style="background-color:#b8ddf3; padding:10px;">
    <p><strong>Assessing the Estimate of Coverage Gains in the  Nonexpansion States</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We conducted  several analyses to assess the significant gains in coverage for low-income  adults in nonexpansion states between June 2014 and September 2014, which drove  the overall decline in uninsurance estimated for adults in those states between  September 2013 and September 2014. These analyses included (but were not  limited to) (1) a comparison across quarters of the characteristics of the HRMS  sample, survey respondents, and survey nonrespondents to see if the results  could be attributed to changes in sampling or response patterns; (2) the use of  alternative regression-adjustment models that included additional demographic  and socioeconomic characteristics, interactions between quarters and  characteristics, and measures of sampling for the survey and survey response in  previous rounds of the HRMS<a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> to see whether there was evidence of panel conditioning; (3) a comparison between  changes in the uninsurance rate among those who completed the survey in the  previous quarter (June 2014) and the change for the portion of each sample that  did not complete the survey in both quarters, to test whether changes reported by  individuals followed over time were consistent with those estimated for the  remaining sample; and (4) an analysis of coverage changes in individual states  to see whether there were changes in coverage in particular states that were  driving the results. Our results were robust to all of the sensitivity tests  that were conducted. We found no evidence that the results were driven by  changing sample or respondent characteristics, by outlier states, or by sample  members&rsquo; participation in earlier rounds of the survey.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We also  benchmarked our estimates with external data sources where possible, including  administrative data and data from other surveys. The overall coverage gains for  low-income adults in nonexpansion states between September 2013 and September  2014 are consistent with administrative data on the change in Medicaid and CHIP  enrollment in nonexpansion states between July through September 2013 and  September 2014 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2014a, 2014b).<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, most of those enrollment gains occurred before June 2014 in the  administrative data. One possible explanation for the HRMS data showing a gain  between June 2014 and September 2014 is that individuals with Medicaid applications  in processing backlogs may not have realized they were covered by Medicaid as  they waited for official notice of Medicaid coverage. Administrative data would  capture coverage gains caused by retrospective eligibility that would not be  reported by the individual.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  comparison to data from other sources included a comparison to findings from  the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which has a much larger sample size  than the HRMS. Though the patterns of change across quarters are different (Gallup  data shows no decline in uninsurance beyond quarter 2 2014), both the HRMS and  Gallup show a 5.3 percentage-point decline in uninsurance among nonelderly  adults between quarter 3 2013 and quarter 3 2014 (data not shown).<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> HRMS and Gallup also estimate similar reductions in uninsurance in expansion  states (6.4 percentage points in Gallup compared with 5.8 percentage points in  the HRMS) and nonexpansion states (4.3 percentage points in Gallup compared  with 4.8 percentage points in the HRMS). Furthermore, the two data sources are  generally consistent when coverage changes are compared across broad income and  age groups.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Finally,  HRMS and Gallup estimates of the change in the overall uninsurance rate for  nonelderly adults in both expansion and nonexpansion states are similar to estimated  changes between 2013 and 2014 reported by Enroll America and Civis Analytics,  which rely on a different methodology than both the HRMS and Gallup.<a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> They estimate that the uninsured rate fell by approximately 5.1 percentage  points for the national population of nonelderly adults, including declines of  5.7 percentage points in Medicaid expansion states and 4.4 percentage points in  nonexpansion states.</p></div>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p><em>The gains  in coverage benefited adults across all age, sex, and race and ethnicity  groups, with stronger gains among groups that historically have had higher  uninsurance rates</em>. As shown in figure 2, there were large gains in coverage for adults ages  18 to 30 (a 7.2 percentage&ndash;point  increase; 95% CI [4.2, 10.3]), nonwhite, non-Hispanic adults (a  6.8 percentage&ndash;point increase; 95% CI [3.6, 10.1]) and Hispanic adults (a 7.7  percentage&ndash;point increase; 95% CI [4.3, 11.0]), groups that have  historically had higher than average uninsurance rates. Coverage rates increased for  both men and women (5.6 percentage  points, 95% CI [3.5, 7.7], and 4.9 percentage points, 95% CI [3.2,  6.7], respectively). Historically, men have  had a higher rate of uninsurance than women.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All of the population subgroups examined in the  expansion states experienced gains in coverage except high-income adults (those  with family incomes at or above 400 percent of FPL). Young adults, men,  and minority adults reported strong gains in insurance coverage. In nonexpansion states, young adults  and women reported the strongest gains. Though the magnitude of coverage gains  for minority adults was greater than the gains for white, non-Hispanic adults,  only the estimated increase in coverage for white, non-Hispanic adults was  statistically significant, likely because of smaller sample sizes for minority  groups in the HRMS.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The uninsurance rate for nonelderly adults has  fallen sharply since the first Marketplace open enrollment period began in  October 2013, with larger gains in states that expanded Medicaid and among  adults targeted by the Medicaid expansion  and the new Marketplace subsidies. Our estimates show that approximately  10.6 million nonelderly adults (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 8.5 million to 12.6 million) gained coverage between September 2013 and September  2014: a 30.1 percent decrease in the national uninsurance rate for this  population. As noted previously (Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Wissoker, Shartzer, et  al. 2014), these estimates do not reflect the effects of ACA provisions implemented before 2013 (such as the ability to keep dependents on  a parent&rsquo;s health plan until  age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions), nor do they account for changes in  health insurance coverage that would have occurred independently of the ACA,  such as those associated with an improving economy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond changes at the  national level, we see a continued drop in uninsurance in the expansion states,  at roughly 6 percentage points in September 2014 (a drop of 36 percent since  September 2013), and, for the first time, a significant drop in uninsurance in  the nonexpansion states: about 5 percentage points in September 2014 (a drop of  24 percent since September 2013). Most of the coverage gains in both the  expansion and nonexpansion states are among  low-income adults targeted by the Medicaid expansion. In the expansion states,  nearly all low-income adults are now eligible for Medicaid; in the nonexpansion  states, low-income adults include those who are eligible for Medicaid under the  state&rsquo;s existing, and lower, income eligibility&nbsp;standards&nbsp;and those  between 100 and 138 percent of FPL who are newly eligible for coverage (and  subsidies) through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the timing of the gains in nonexpansion  states differs across survey and administrative sources, the overall change in  coverage between September 2013 and September 2014 is consistent with existing  survey and administrative data. However, we recognize that the magnitude of the  quarter-to-quarter changes in HRMS do not line up as well with those sources. Consequently,  we will continue to assess the timing of the coverage changes reported throughout  the past year. For example, though we&nbsp;would have expected some increased enrollment  among those previously eligible&nbsp;for Medicaid because of the expanded  outreach and education efforts coinciding with the Marketplace open enrollment  period (Sonier, Boudreaux, and Blewett 2013), administrative data from the end  of May to the end of September suggest that at best, such gains were small in the  nonexpansion states (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2014a, 2014b). However,  the administrative data would include retrospective enrollment decisions, which  may not reflect the respondent&rsquo;s assessment of his or her insurance coverage at  the time of the survey. Individuals who had yet to be informed of their Medicaid  eligibility might well have reported that they were uninsured. We have added  survey&nbsp;questions to the quarter 4 2014 HRMS to better understand coverage  changes&nbsp;among the&nbsp;low-income adults going forward, and we will  benchmark the quarterly HRMS estimates for 2014 against quarterly data from the  National Health Interview Survey as those data become available.</p>

    <p><strong>About the Series</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This brief is part of a series drawing on the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS), a quarterly survey of the nonelderly population that is exploring the value of cutting-edge Internet-based survey methods to monitor the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before data from federal government surveys are available. The briefs provide information on health insurance coverage, access to and use of health care, health care affordability, and self-reported health status, as well as timely data on important implementation issues under the ACA. Funding for the core HRMS is provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Urban Institute. </p>

    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

    <hr width="30%" align="left">

        <p><a name="fn1" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>1</sup>The list of states  that have expanded Medicaid is increasing over time as more states decide to  implement the ACA expansion. States that expanded Medicaid by September 1, 2014, are AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA, KY, MD, MA,  MI, MN, NH, NV, NJ, NM, NY, ND, OH, OR, RI, VT, WA, and WV.  Several of those states, including CA, CT, DC, and MN, expanded Medicaid under  the ACA before 2013. </p>
        <p><a name="fn2" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>2</sup>Benchmarking of the HRMS data against  federal survey data is provided in Long, Kenney, Zuckerman, Goin, et al. 2014.</p>

        <p><a name="fn4" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>4</sup>Because data collection through the National  Health Interview Survey was ongoing between January 2014 and March 2014, this  figure does not fully reflect the change in health insurance coverage that  occurred by March.</p>

        <p><a name="fn6" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>6</sup>Phil Galewitz, <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/June/09/More-Than-17-Million-Consumers-Still-Wait-For-Medicaid-Decisions.aspx">&ldquo;More Than 1.7 Million Consumers Still  Wait for Medicaid Decisions,&rdquo;</a> <em>Kaiser Health News</em>, June 9, 2014.</p>
        <p><a name="fn7" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>7</sup>Although Marketplace coverage for people enrolling between October 2013 and December 2013 did not start until January 2014, some  who signed up in the fall may have reported having coverage during the December 2013 HRMS survey.  Further, some of those seeking coverage through the Marketplace between October  2013 and December 2013 were enrolled in Medicaid. </p>
        <p><a name="fn8" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>8</sup>Specifically, we  control for the variables used in the poststratification weighting of the KnowledgePanel (the internet-based survey panel that  underlies the HRMS) and the poststratification weighting of the HRMS.&nbsp; These variables are sex, age, race and ethnicity, language, education, marital status, whether any children are present in the household, household income, family income as a percentage of FPL, homeownership  status, internet access, urban or rural status, and census region. In this analysis, we also control for  citizenship status and participation in the previous quarter&rsquo;s survey (i.e., whether the respondent completed the survey in the previous quarter, was sampled in the previous quarter but did not complete the survey, or was not sampled in the previous quarter). </p>
        <p><a name="fn9" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>9</sup>In this brief, we are not looking at the effects  of the ACA on  coverage for children, but  we recognize that their coverage and well-being may be affected by their parent&rsquo;s enrollment  in coverage or by other ACA provisions. </p>
        <p><a name="fn10" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>10</sup>We use 2014 national population predictions available from the US Census Bureau. These files give population  projections by race, ethnicity, and sex of all ages from 2012 to 2060 based on estimated birth rates, death rates, and net  migration rates. Using the &ldquo;Table 1, Middle Series&rdquo; file (which has a 2014 projected population of 318,892,103), we summed the 2014 population projections for all 18-to-64-year-olds to arrive at 198,461,688 nonelderly adults in 2014. See US Census Bureau, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.census.gov/population/projections/data/national/2012/downloadablefiles.html">2012 National Population Projections: Downloadable Files</a>,&rdquo; US Department of Commerce, last revised May 15, 2013. </p>
        <p><a name="fn11" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>11</sup>The uninsurance  estimates reported here differ from some  early estimates reported elsewhere. This reflects two factors: (1) we revised the editing process for insurance coverage in quarter 3  2013 to make better use of  information from an open-ended follow-up question that was added in quarter 2  2013 to learn the type of insurance coverage of those who said they were covered but did not pick a  type of coverage from the list provided,  and (2) the regression-adjusted estimates are always based on the most recent  four quarters of data (this brief, for example, uses quarter 4 2013 and  quarters 1&ndash;3 2014). </p>
        <p><a name="fn12" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>12</sup>Because the HRMS is drawn from an  Internet panel, there is the possibility of panel conditioning (American  Association for Public Opinion Research 2010). To assess the possibility of  such bias, we estimate models that included (1) the number of past quarters in  which respondents completed the survey, (2) the number of past quarters in  which the respondent was included in the HRMS sample but did not respond to the  survey, (3) the number of quarters included in the HRMS sample, and (4) simple  dummy variables for whether respondents completed the survey or did not respond  to the survey in any past quarter.</p>
        <p><a name="fn13" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>13</sup>Between July 2013 through September 2013 and September 2014, Medicaid and CHIP enrollment increased by about 1.3 million people (both children and adults of all ages) in nonexpansion states, including Pennsylvania, where the Medicaid expansion will not take effect until 2015 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2014b). Though the HRMS only distinguishes between adults with incomes at or below 100 percent of FPL and those with incomes 100&ndash;138 percent of FPL beginning in the September 2014 round, combining lower-income adults&rsquo; estimated September 2013 to September 2014 coverage gain in nonexpansion states with the estimated September 2014 population of poor adults in nonexpansion states shows an increase in coverage of about 1.6 million poor adults, if we assume that they experienced the same change as all low-income adults in nonexpansion states. Therefore, our estimates may overstate the gains in coverage among poor adults in nonexpansion states. Simultaneously, we may be understating the gains in expansion states. Administrative data show Medicaid/CHIP enrollment growth of about 7.8 million from July 2013 through September 2013 to September 2014; our estimates imply a total coverage gain of about 6.4 million for nonelderly adults of all income groups. </p>
        <p><a name="fn14" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>14</sup>Quarterly estimates of uninsurance among  nonelderly adults at the time of the Gallup survey were provided by the US  Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation. These estimates are based on survey data collected  throughout the quarter (e.g., July through September 2014 for quarter 3 2014,  compared with HRMS estimates for quarter 3 2014 that rely on surveys completed  only in September).  We thank staff at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation for providing these tabulations.
