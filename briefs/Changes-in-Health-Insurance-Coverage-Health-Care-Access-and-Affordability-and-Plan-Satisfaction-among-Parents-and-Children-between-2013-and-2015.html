	<p>The Urban Institute&rsquo;s Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS)  has been tracking health insurance coverage and related outcomes among parents  and children since mid-2013. A previous HRMS analysis found a decline of 5.8  percentage points in the uninsurance rate for parents, with particularly large  declines among low-income and Hispanic parents and a narrowing of the difference  in uninsurance rates between parents and children through early 2015 (Karpman  et al. 2015). This brief uses new data collected in September 2015 and previous  HRMS rounds to assess how health insurance coverage and several measures of  health care access, affordability, and satisfaction with health plans have  changed for parents and children between 2013, just before the major coverage  provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were implemented, and 2015, after  the completion of the second open enrollment period.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	   <p>The ACA included many policy changes (e.g., Medicaid expansion,  tax credits for coverage offered through the new health insurance Marketplaces,  insurance reforms, and an individual mandate) designed to increase coverage  among nonelderly adults, including parents living with their dependent  children. Children were not the primary target of the ACA&rsquo;s coverage provisions  given that they have had substantially lower uninsurance rates than parents and  other adults. But coverage was expected to increase among children under the  ACA because of a combination of policies, including the expansion of Medicaid  to more parents, tax credits for Marketplace coverage, new outreach and  enrollment efforts, and the individual mandate. Several federal surveys have  found declines in uninsurance among adults and children since 2013 (Alker and  Chester 2015; Martinez and Cohen 2015; Smith and Medalia 2015), but these  analyses have not addressed changes for parents and few have focused on how other health  care indicators, such as health care access, affordability, and satisfaction  with health plans, have been changing. Among the many reasons for studying  these outcomes for parents are the potential spillover benefits to children of extending  coverage to parents, which has been shown to be associated with increases in children&rsquo;s coverage (Dubay  and Kenney 2003) and use of care (Davidoff et al. 2003), and the linkage of parents&rsquo; health  and financial stability to the health  and well-being of their children (Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson 2002; Glied and  Oellerich 2014).</p>
	   <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What We Did</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	   <p>This brief draws on several rounds of HRMS data, the latest  of which were collected in September 2015 based on questions from the core HRMS and its child supplement (HRMS-Kids), to assess changes in health insurance coverage,  access, affordability, and plan satisfaction among parents ages 18 to 64 and  children ages 0 to 17. In each round of the HRMS, approximately 7,500  nonelderly adults complete the survey. The HRMS-Kids was added to the HRMS in the  second quarter of 2013 to ask questions about a randomly selected child in  respondents&rsquo; households, yielding information on approximately 2,400 children each  round. Our definition of parents, which is based on information provided in the  HRMS-Kids, includes all parents and other legal guardians living with a  dependent child age 17 or under. In some cases, adults who are not parents or  guardians (e.g., other relatives or nonrelatives) respond to the HRMS child  supplement questions on behalf of a randomly selected child in the household; those  cases are excluded from analyses of parents and guardians but are included in  those that pertain to children.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
	   <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> We examine changes between June/September 2013 and  March/September 2015.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> Data from June and September 2013 and data from March and September 2015 are  pooled to increase the precision of our estimates.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> The exception is for the plan satisfaction questions, in which we focus on  changes between June 2013 and September 2015.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	   <p>Estimates of coverage for children reported in this  brief differ from previous estimates because of a revised editing process that  is more consistent with the editing process used for adults in the HRMS. This change  uses other information from the survey to identify the coverage status of  children reported as covered but for whom respondents did not report a specific  type of coverage from the list provided in the survey.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Each round of the HRMS and HRMS-Kids is  weighted to be nationally representative. We use  these weights and regression adjustment to control for differences in the  demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents and their  children across the different rounds of the survey.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> This allows us to remove any variation in coverage, access,  affordability, or plan satisfaction caused by changes in the observable characteristics  of people responding to the survey over time. However, the basic patterns shown  for the regression-adjusted measures are similar to those based solely on  simple weighted estimates.<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> We focus on statistically significant changes in coverage and other  outcomes over time, defined as differences that are significantly different  from zero at the 5 percent level or lower. We provide a 95 percent confidence  interval (CI) for key estimates.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Though  HRMS estimates capture the changes in coverage, access, affordability, and plan  satisfaction under the first and second open enrollment periods of the ACA, the  estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions (such as  the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26, early state  Medicaid expansions, and the maintenance of eligibility provision for children)  that were implemented before 2013. In addition, these estimates reflect  changes beyond the effects of the ACA because they do not control for long-term  trends in health insurance coverage, access, affordability, or plan  satisfaction that predate the ACA or control for changes in the business cycle.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What We Found</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <em>Between June/September  2013 and March/September 2015, the shares of parents who were insured all year  and insured at the time of the survey increased substantially; children also had coverage gains, but they were smaller in magnitude.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Both parents and children experienced gains in health  insurance coverage between June/September 2013 and March/September 2015. The  share of parents reporting coverage at the time of the survey increased 6.4  percentage points (95% CI [5.1, 7.8]) during this period, and the share of children  with coverage increased 1.7 percentage points ((95% CI [0.6, 2.8]; figure 1).<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> The share of parents who were insured  for all of the past 12 months also increased 5.5 percentage points (95% CI  [3.9, 7.1]), and children saw a 1.9 percentage-point (95% CI [0.4, 3.4]) increase  in full-year coverage. Though the estimated change in both measures of coverage  was higher for parents, children started from a higher baseline rate of  coverage. According to the HRMS, the percentage of parents with coverage at the time of the survey  increased from 83.2 to 89.6 percent, compared to an increase in the share of  covered children from 94.7 to 96.4 percent (table 1).<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> As of March/September 2015, 89.8 percent of children and 80.3 percent of  parents were reported to be insured for all of the past 12 months.</p>

   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><em>Access to health care  improved for parents and was unchanged for children.</em> </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>  Compared with parents surveyed in June/September 2013, parents  surveyed in March/September 2015 were 1.7 percentage points (95% CI [0.1, 3.4])  more likely to report having a usual source of care, 3.7 percentage points (95%  CI [1.2, 6.1]) more likely to report getting a routine checkup in the past  year, and 2.9 percentage points (95% CI [1.0, 4.8]) less likely to report  trouble finding a doctor in the past year (figure 2). There were no  statistically significant changes in any of these measures reported for  children during this period. For each measure, however, children had higher  levels of access to care than parents in both June/September 2013 and  March/September 2015 (table 1).<a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> </p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><a href="../images/Brief36_Fig2.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/Brief36_Fig2.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><em>Fewer parents report that  they went without care for affordability reasons or struggled to pay family medical  bills.</em></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
	 <p>  Health care affordability has also improved for families  with children. Between June/September 2013 and March/September 2015, there was  a 4.0 percentage-point (95% CI [1.7, 6.2]) decline in the share of parents  reporting that they went without health care,<a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> excluding dental care, in the past 12 months because they could not afford it  (figure 3).  There was also a 6.2  percentage-point (95% CI [4.1, 8.4]) decline in the share with an unmet need  for dental care for affordability reasons. The share of parents reporting unmet  needs for two or more types of health care in the past 12 months declined 4.4  percentage points (95% CI [2.6, 6.1]). The only statistically significant  change among the three unmet need measures for children was a 1.8 percentage-point  (95% CI [0.1, 3.5]) decrease in the share of children with unmet needs for  dental care. The share of children with unmet needs for care was substantially  lower than the share of parents with unmet needs in both 2013 and 2015 (table  1).</p>
	 <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a href="../images/Brief36_Fig3.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/Brief36_Fig3.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Parents reported a 5.6 percentage-point (95% CI [3.4, 7.8])  drop in problems paying family medical bills in the past 12 months between  June/September 2013 and March/September 2015. Relative to 2013, 2015 HRMS data  also show declines in reported problems paying children&rsquo;s medical bills and  increased confidence in being able to meet children&rsquo;s health care needs (figure  4). For instance, the share of respondents reporting problems paying their  child&rsquo;s medical bills in the past 12 months declined 4.2 percentage points (95%  CI [2.7, 5.6]). The share of respondents reporting that they are very or  somewhat confident their child could get health care if the child needed it increased  3.3 percentage points (95% CI [1.0, 5.6]).</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><a href="../images/Brief36_Fig4.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/Brief36_Fig4.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><em>Insured parents report  higher satisfaction with the financial aspects of their coverage, and respondents  reported higher satisfaction with financial and nonfinancial aspects of their  children&rsquo;s coverage.</em></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Between June 2013 and September 2015, the proportion of  insured parents reporting that they are very or somewhat satisfied with their  premiums increased 7.8 percentage point (95% CI [5.2, 10.4]) and the share  reporting satisfaction with the protection their coverage provides against high  medical bills increased 4.1 percentage points (95% CI [1.4, 6.8]; figure 5). Higher  satisfaction was also reported for multiple aspects of plans covering children,  including satisfaction with premiums (7.7 percentage points; 95% CI [4.5, 10.8]);  co-payments and coinsurance (7.6 percentage points; 95% CI [5.0, 10.3]); the range  of health care services available (3.4 percentage points; 95% CI [0.8, 5.9]);  and choice of doctors and other providers (2.6 percentage points; 95% CI [0.1, 5.0]). </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><a href="../images/Brief36_Fig5.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/Brief36_Fig5.png" alt="" width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Some of these increases in plan satisfaction may reflect  previously insured parents becoming more satisfied with their or their  children&rsquo;s coverage, which in some cases may be more comprehensive following  the implementation of the ACA&rsquo;s essential benefit provisions. They may also  reflect increased satisfaction because of new financial assistance through  premium tax credits or cost sharing reductions. However, it is also possible that some of the increase  in plan satisfaction reflects a shift in the composition of the population of  insured parents and children as those previously uninsured gained coverage  through Medicaid, obtained coverage through a subsidized Marketplace plan, or  took up an offer of employer-based coverage.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>What It Means</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Parents experienced notable gains in insurance coverage,  access to care, and health care affordability between June/September 2013 and  March/September 2015. Over this period, children experienced statistically significant,  but smaller, percentage-point gains in coverage relative to their parents,  indicating further increases in coverage among children that build on the high coverage  rates that children had before the implementation of the major coverage  provisions of the ACA (Rosenbaum and Kenney 2014). Although some of the  improvements for children and parents may be caused by factors other than the  ACA, these data suggest that the health insurance and health care landscapes have  improved for parents: fewer parents report being uninsured, being without a  usual source of care, having trouble finding a doctor or struggling to pay  medical bills, or having unmet needs for care because care was not affordable. Fewer  statistically significant changes were found in access and affordability among  children, but where stastically significant changes were found, they pointed to improvements in access and affordability. Moreover, parents with insurance report higher levels of satisfaction with  financial aspects of their plans, and respondents reported higher satisfaction  with financial and nonfinancial aspects of children&rsquo;s plans, suggesting  coverage gains have not occurred at the expense of overall coverage quality.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> These results raise the question of what is driving the  coverage gains for parents and children. Future research will address the  source of the coverage gains and attempt to assess the extent to which the gains  in coverage for parents and children are the result of the ACA rather than the  improving economy or other factors. Though this brief found improvements in  coverage and related outcomes for parents, millions of parents remain  uninsured.<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> Moreover, whether the coverage, access, and affordability improvements reported  in this brief can be sustained and augmented will depend in part on the success  of outreach and enrollment assistance efforts for the third open enrollment  period and whether Medicaid take-up rates increase among eligible parents and  children (Karpman, Gates, and Kenney 2015). </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Further gains in coverage would also be possible if Medicaid  is expanded in the 20 states that have not yet pursued this option under the  ACA. Several of the largest nonexpansion states have particularly low income  eligibility thresholds in Medicaid, such as Florida  (34 percent of the federal poverty level [FPL]), Georgia (37 percent of FPL),  North Carolina (44 percent of FPL), Texas (18 percent of FPL), and Virginia (44  percent of FPL).<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> A  recent analysis of American Community Survey data found that children&rsquo;s  uninsurance rates fell more sharply between 2013 and 2014 in states that  expanded Medicaid for adults than in states that did not expand Medicaid (Alker  and Chester 2015), which highlights the potential for additional gains in  coverage for children from new state decisions to expand Medicaid.</p>

    <p><strong>About the Series</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This brief is part of a series drawing on the HRMS, a quarterly survey of the nonelderly population that explores the value of cutting-edge Internet-based survey methods to monitor the ACA before data from federal government surveys are available. Funding for the core HRMS is provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. This brief was funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and funding from an anonymous donor. It draws on the HRMS-Kids, which was conducted in partnership with the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University and is currently funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and an anonymous donor. The authors are grateful to Sharon K. Long, Douglas Wissoker, Nathaniel Anderson, Stacey McMorrow, Lisa Clemans-Cope, Lisa Dubay, Joan Alker, Tricia Brooks, and Liane Wong for their input on the HRMS-Kids and to Stacey McMorrow for helpful comments on this brief. </p>

    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

    <hr width="30%" align="left">

       <p> <a name="fn1" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>1</sup>The  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services extended a special open enrollment  period for the federally facilitated Marketplace from March 15, 2015, to April  30, 2015, to individuals who (1) did not have coverage in 2014, (2) were  subject to the tax penalty for not having coverage in that year, and (3) became  aware of the tax penalty after the end of the second open enrollment period  (February 15, 2015) in connection with preparing their taxes (see Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/mediareleasedatabase/press-releases/2015-press-releases-items/2015-02-20.html">&ldquo;CMS Announces Special  Enrollment Period for Tax Season,&rdquo;</a> press release, February 20, 2015). Most state-based  Marketplaces also extended special enrollment periods to these individuals (Manatt  Health Solutions 2015).</p> 
     
        <p><a name="fn2" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>2</sup>In the September 2015 HRMS, 94.4 percent of adults reporting on behalf of  children were parents or guardians. </p>

        <p><a name="fn3" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>3</sup>  We focus on estimated  changes in coverage because estimates of the level of coverage often vary  across surveys because of differences in survey design (State Health Access  Data Assistance Center 2013).&nbsp;In some rounds of the survey, the  interview month starts a few days before or lasts a few days after the target  month.</p>

        <p><a name="fn4" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>4</sup>  We use June/September 2013 because the child supplement questions were not  included in the initial round of the HRMS (January to March 2013). We use  March/September 2015 data because the HRMS was not fielded in June 2015: the  HRMS shifted to a semiannual fielding schedule after March 2015. In addition,  the child supplement questions were not included in the December 2014 round of  the HRMS.</p>
 
        <p><a name="fn5" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>5</sup>  Questions regarding satisfaction with health plans were not asked about  children&rsquo;s plans in September 2013 and were not asked about adults&rsquo; plans in  March 2015. </p>
  
        <p><a name="fn6" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>6</sup>  The revised editing process generates an estimate of the level of coverage for  children that is 1 to 2 percentage points higher each round than the level  estimated under the previous method. Because the revision is applied to all  quarters of data, however, the estimated changes in coverage for children between  June/September 2013 and March/September 2015 are similar under each method (1.7  percentage points with the revised method and significant at the 0.01 level  versus 1.1 percentage points under the previous method and significant at the  0.10 level). We also revised the editing process for estimating children&rsquo;s  previous coverage levels, leading to a slightly lower estimate of the share of  children insured for all of the past 12 months, but the change has no effect on  the estimated change over time.</p>

        <p><a name="fn7" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>7</sup>  We control for the  variables used in poststratification of both the KnowledgePanel (the nationally  representative Internet panel maintained by GfK Custom Research from which HRMS  samples are drawn) and the HRMS, including gender, age, race/ethnicity,  language, education, marital status, presence of children in the household,  household income, family income, homeownership status, Internet access,  urban/rural status, and region. We also control for citizenship status and  participation in the previous quarter&rsquo;s survey. For children, we include all of  the control variables for respondents as well as controls for the child&rsquo;s  gender, age, and race/ethnicity, and for the number of children in the  household.</p>
   
        <p><a name="fn8" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>8</sup> In presenting the  regression-adjusted estimates, we use the predicted rate of each measure in  each quarter or set of pooled quarters for the same nationally representative  population. For this analysis, we base the nationally representative sample on  parents from the first and third quarters of 2014 and the first and third  quarters of 2015 when examining changes in outcomes for parents and on children  from the first and third quarters of 2014 and the first and third quarters of  2015 when examining changes in outcomes for children. The direction and  magnitude of the estimated unadjusted changes in outcomes are similar to the  estimated regression-adjusted changes reported in this brief.</p>
   
        <p><a name="fn9" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>9</sup> These changes represented a narrowing gap in coverage between children and parents during this period, as the difference in coverage changes for the two groups was statistically significant. According to estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, the share of children  with coverage (based on reported coverage at the time of the survey) increased  2 percentage points between 2013 and the first half of 2015, from 93.5 percent  to 95.5 percent (Martinez and Cohen 2015). </p>
     
        <p><a name="fn10" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>10</sup>  Estimated levels of coverage for nonelderly adults and children in the HRMS are  somewhat higher than estimates from other nonfederal and federal surveys. Such  differences may be caused by differences in survey design and processes for  assigning coverage status (Karpman, Long and Huntress 2015).</p>
   
        <p><a name="fn11" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>11</sup>  &ldquo;Trouble  finding a doctor&rdquo; for children includes difficulty in the past 12 months  finding a general doctor or other primary care provider, a specialist, or a dentist  who would see them. For parents, &ldquo;trouble finding a doctor&rdquo; includes difficulty  in the past 12 months finding a doctor or other health care provider who would  see them.</p>
     
        <p><a name="fn12" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>12</sup> Unmet  needs for care for parents include prescription drugs, medical care, general  doctor care, specialist care, tests, treatment or follow-up care, dental care,  and mental health care or counseling. Unmet needs for care for children include  each of those types of care as well as eyeglasses or vision care.</p>
      
        <p><a name="fn13" style="text-decoration:none;"></a><sup>13</sup> Unpublished Urban Institute tabulations of the National Health Interview Survey  data find that 15.7 percent of parents and guardians were uninsured in 2014. </p>
